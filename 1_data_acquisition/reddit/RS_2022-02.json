give my perspective on why deflation is economically sound for Inflation of a fiat currency and deflation can bankrupt slow down economic activity and lead to unemployment Central balance by a inflation keeping some margin for lowering nominal interest to in For the potential issue with deflation is restricted to economic activity have two attractive in the proof of stake ecosystem locking up their for or in the smart contract economy Issuance of new to is the only source of inflation in the system Inflation can thus be produced by increasing the yield but this will slow down activity not increase it since it people to lock up their for instead of with smart A deflationary where the burn rate is higher than the issuance rate capital and that wish to capture that capital Thus deflation is economically sound for considering its forthcoming proof of stake consensus From time to time it is that should be inflationary like fiat so that are to spend their not just hold them It is important to understand the difference between a central bank trying to balance the desire for high employment and low steady inflation of its fiat currency system with that of a proof of stake trying to make its smart contract economy flourish network effects Central commonly target a inflation A too high inflation will erode real wages and lead to rising between social and costly of disinflation of deflation on the other hand are often associated with economic crises and As demand reduce their have a hard time paying back their in nominal and the subsequent remove liquidity a deflationary spiral Wages would need to fall each year to keep up but a downward wage rigidity can be In the absence of yearly pay unemployment may rise further The fact that people can increase their wealth by hoarding cash is also detrimental to economic activity in of deflation Thus a inflation target central some down to so that they can lower nominal interest in to spur economic activity avoid deflation traps and reduce unemployment The of proof of stake like are a little different Deflation a rise in the value of the token but wages are not in and neither are Deflation does not bring potential unemployment or debt It is rather a fall in price that can be with among those that lent out their in return for some other form of value like The of reduced economic activity due to wealth from hoarding cash out as the most applicable also for hoarding in this case Certainly it is desirable with high economic activity and demand It to the ecosystem and build the network effects that cement as the engine of Web But now consider the two most interesting available to token in proof of stake They may lock up their by them earning yield or they may use the for economic activity with smart Issuance of new to is the only source of inflation in the system The higher the yield the higher the inflationary pressure The higher the yield the more desirable to lock up instead of in the economy Thus the relationship between deflation and economic activity is reversed in comparison with the fiat economy are a vital part of the ecosystem and should of course be for their work But far away from minimum viable issuance to produce inflation will simply constitute a transfer of wealth from those that participate to those that lock up their Of course not all of participation may result in high transaction volume But the mere fact that capital is available and ready to be is important for enticing smart contract to build If the yield is up to produce inflation the tough competition from the yield of the contract development on the chain It is perhaps not surprising that innovation and economic activity exploded on The promise of an economically sound proof of stake consensus in the future in combination with yield due to proof of work in the short term is an attractive proposition for because it a lot of capital willing to invest in their Higher than yield would also force willing into a money of which systematic to any ecosystem of dependent on them In a deflationary people can hold without seeing their eroded and use them for whenever needs in their daily life arise Naturally it would be possible to produce inflation without pushing up the yield if the could fund some other desirable development The problem is that public goods is very tricky and would undoubtedly lead to friction in the community is not all in the same way that fiat money is within a country can leave the economy at any time if they perceive that their are diluted for questionable or This is a good thing By the value of the token we attract people to the ecosystem in open competition Another way to look at this is to recognize that the deflationary pressure comes from high demand for via the burn mechanism of and the inflationary pressure to keep the chain secure through issuance As long as the chain is secure deflation is a sign of an in demand protocol One last thing in relation to s law en slaw bad money out good which is often in support of inflationary It is important to note that s law is applicable for two of money with different inherent value but where legal tender that they must be for the same value This is not applicable for especially considering the fact that of money in can easily be on the open market after it for payment For all these I believe that deflation is economically sound for","272":"La global la in heart of el been today by This will be a new education and training center based in San providing free and accessible learning

this t your account so then you think how about maybe a fake ID But this teller is superhumanly good at spotting so that s a no go Then after poking around a bit you discover that this bank some really bad because it turns out that they allow you to bring your own teller to verify the transaction So you call up your friend and go hey make a quick buck He goes sure and again you walk into the

amount of stolen the way both of them were handled was very different People claim that t enough a coefficient of meaning that must collude to halt the network those make up of the network so it t enough to achieve consensus but it is enough to break quorum On the other hand and have a coefficient of under meaning that than mining make up more than of the network That that is actually significantly more based on coefficient and that number is to grow with the non custodial stake becoming more popular Furthermore there are k for reference there are around k on so that s not a bad

distribution always better over time is still a relatively young network Network went down in for and t been down since then The reason the network went down is that were high compute over consensus this now been fixed There was no off switch the on their own from the overload and effect There was no on switch either in fact it took because of the by stake to come back to achieve consensus on the upgrade Despite that people keep saying network is down like every other week when it s not Fine are only running at a few hundred not included instead of a few thousand during these of congestion so maybe it s a bit and you have to try a few times but people here will say that the network when it t This congestion is a sign of high activity on the chain and when this to other and increase significantly t currently have a fee market but the are currently working on building one and also tackling this problem of high congestion in a creative way by increasing only on the smart causing congestion while the rest of the network to operate with normal Furthermore despite the occasional congestion smart that actually work most of the time and scale to large of concurrent looking at you

with how a DAO so I ended up reading up on the project I learned that s are to mint governance to and use the funds of the mint to purchase top tier with the expectation to turn a profit by selling them when the space up of the DAO are able to submit of potential as well as vote on said if they hold a token Now that s all well and fun but it got me thinking if there were any DAO s that exist in the real world that the same way a business would This was really cool to me and me to look into how a DAO a bit more What I discovered is that a DAO in theory could replace and as we know them No more s and no more Instead everything is by the people with the use of tech The fact that into a project and the going directly back to its revolutionary to me I know there got to be a way to implement real life use with s and I believe one of the best ways to do that is through a DAO becoming popular Now I have some with this as well One of those is that if a token you voting power and a whale up a large majority of the from a DAO to have maximum voting power how is that different from a the majority of for a company and Of course people with just token at least are able to voice their opinion as well as vote Which is different from a small investor holding a small amount of in a company because at least they have a say in the decision making process Another concern would be is that we all know that the people don t always have the best to a problem and could end up hurting the performance of the DAO My last question is could a DAO potentially eliminate the need to pay state or local I m not sure about your neck of the but it like where I live that nothing is ever done about the poor infrastructure in my area and that my go towards nothing I was wondering if it could make sense to instead of paying these we could eliminate local and state and have the people fund vote as well as profit off of fixing their just a thought I am not very educated in this area Just something that peaked me interest recently as I am looking to start my own business and would love to be able to bring the world to life with real life use somehow Would love for anyone to help educate me in this or provide any feedback or of your own Thanks","518":"bought some and i to make sure that not taxed to it forever Does the new tax apply to me Do I need to pay the tax","519":"First

going to talk about the third iteration of the site it is good to explain what the previous two were like The first iteration of the web was read only This that on the server and could only read them They t need to log in and no one their identity All information was freely available Those who to publish had to have access to the server where they could save the article Open source were used for Web The basic were and the most used It can be said that the was free Web was born during the dot bubble in the new millennium and is by the fact that can create and share information This is the as we know it today It could be as read write were given the ability to create and publish their own content It t have to be just but also on or short on Twitter Web to be free because the Big Five pay the for running and took control of the content and the Many today require to log in Digital identity is important so it s not surprising that like and Twitter have taken control These act as identity This that digital are by that have trust Today if you want to log in to a service you can do so through your with the above have convenience for precious information which they hand over to the IT who profit from it completely free of charge Web are Web the of the with the ability to own As a content creator I have no control over the platform where my content is I don t own the text and the platform who to read it If the platform not to publish the text I m out of luck If the platform to delete my account it can do so at any time I will immediately lose access to my The goal of Web is to enable people to own their content identity identity related data money and other People will decide what they want to share and who to send it to In addition Web comes with the idea of partially the platform itself If the Web platform money from advertising it can keep everything to itself In the case of ownership it is possible that the profit is split fairly between and the platform Web can be as read write own Web are similar to If you think about it more you will find that Web basically the key of the Let s demonstrate this on the network Anyone in the world can a wallet and start the network to interact financially or socially with their is a global network and is available everywhere There is no need to ask anyone for permission Once a user a transaction she is almost sure that no one will censor it No one can confiscate somewhere in the middle of the process Key are through network decentralization and financial We can say that with we have a platform that is by the community and not by a central authority This will be true as long as the are well distributed among Any network can be as a collection of that are written in the source code In the network for example it is thus tightly defined what exactly to do with the collected and how they are distributed between the platform and the such as can also be as an organization that can be through can enable voting and possibly the or of the service The ability to modify the and evolve is quite crucial for the further development of the service Centralization is advantageous in that can be or development directed instantly Unfortunately centralization is also a weak point in of abuse of power are popular for many One of them is the key fact that they are not by central This it possible to ensure the immutability of the which were set up fairly for everyone at the outset If the were to change it would be a collective decision of the majority As a matter of principle only those that are favorable to the majority will be enforced Control over the the crucial difference between a and a system At the same time it is a key feature in of the possibility of or ownership In the ideal world of Web no one can take value away from you or prevent you from it It can be said that Web is an effort to achieve a greater degree of decentralization on the People could enjoy a higher level of freedom on Web but the did not offer many useful Web greatly expanded the useful but at the cost of centralization by of power Freedom also and it can be said that the power of IT constantly Web to weaken the power of the big IT and put the power back in the of the This is essentially the same principle that is trying to achieve at the level of money A certain portion of that can weaken the position of central and replace fiat money and Web have essentially the exact same goal They seek to give people more control over their destiny and give them the ability to avoid third that exercise their strong position Web realize the original vision of If people strive for independence want to trust technology more and prefer collective decision making over central the path to this goal is through decentralization seek to redefine the social contract which is nothing more than the by which society is Winning over central is as big a challenge as trying to beat the IT Both are important to the path to freedom If people understand the meaning of decentralization and its they will want to promote its wherever possible and technologically feasible One could even say that it no sense to pursue free money and leave social and everything else in the of If the concept of decentralization hold it will bring about fundamental societal and we cannot predict what society will look like and what its will be at the moment Web is nothing more than technology and centralization from a different side than originally intended at the birth of Why it is important to own the infrastructure There is a direct link between your ownership and the network You can exclusively own or through a private key and no one in the world can take it away from you However this is only true as long as and the network exist and maintain a high degree of decentralization Should the network cease to exist the will immediately lose value as well If someone the network consensus the network will cease to be and thus there is no guarantee that the will be People need to learn that if they want to gain control of their assets it s not just about protecting their own private It is also in the interest of to maintain a high level of decentralization of the network is a digital technology built on of power distribution This power must be truly distributed among as many as possible It must be easy and affordable to participate in decentralization In the ecosystem it is very easy to participate in decentralization because each coin owner essentially a portion of the decision making power Thus each coin holder essentially a small or portion of the infrastructure that his or her own assets If economically all coin can be with the protocol There is a direct economic incentive to participate in decentralization and decide the future direction of the platform Web will have more Complex are often dependent on multiple and Web will have more as well Each layer will have different and can provide a given functional part of the overall functionality The first layer is crucial for and value so a high level of decentralization and security is important The network will oversee the correct number of as well as all Moreover the network will be used as a public key infrastructure to create a digital identity DID can protect private data The first layer is also where smart are Smart can be seen as a key on chain layer for the functionality of Web layer is by and an incentive model The level of decentralization should be the highest can issue their own for a similar purpose These will be by the first tamper proof layer but it can be that there will always be token than coin The degree of decentralization may be lower In general the first of Web will enable related to creation of value ownership and transfer of value All other will place more emphasis on a pleasant user interface which they can be less The higher will use the and infrastructure of the lower The faster technology the more the higher can become It is important to realize that will be the who decide to what extent decentralization and security are important to them At the moment no one the answer All we know now is that people are not very willing to install full on their In the case of it s not even possible In addition are not willing to compromise on their for user comfort and it is questionable how much they will be willing to pay for The approach of can be individual but we already know how the majority behave People are willing to buy and don t mind holding them through third like or They use for This is not very encouraging news for decentralization Essentially all second will compete with and therefore need to be on a par in of ease of use This will be difficult to achieve if a high level of decentralization is to be The population is not at all ready for the concept of decentralization and it may take another decade before it is a preferred feature for them The of specific will have to decide which of their must be and which must not For example for the most important feature is good So the game itself does not need to be on the However if it will be possible to earn stable or in the game the only thing that is that the are always actually and the team or anyone else cannot deprive them of their winnings from a central authority position It s easy to imagine card game locking in their before the game and the smart contract who to send the winnings to when it s over The user interface needs have nothing to do with decentralization or as long as it is that no player any advantage from poor game design We expect that people will trust open source more the potential to kick start entirely new business One of the of the project is to enable peer to peer from people in rich towards people in People are used to borrowing from or from a bank In recent it become clear that people are willing to lend to each other and Peer to Peer is on the rise Identity verification is quite crucial in this business Unfortunately people from often do not have This it difficult for them to take out a loan Providing people with a digital identity and them to take out a loan is a goal for The Peer to Peer service will be composed of multiple like authentication stable matching supply and demand digital for local currency transferring value the contract between will exist on different with different of decentralization Note that even if participant authentication was completely or with local the can be The existence of stable the contract between and the transfer of value can be Wait t peer to peer fall more into the realm of You re right it does Web to give control back to and allow them to own basically anything that may have value is really just a subset of Web that on financial Ownership and decentralization We have said that the ability to exclusively own or share ownership is a key feature between Web and Web Related to this is the ability to create value What is actually the difference between native protocol such as and other The only difference is that the protocol t allow the existence of more than and the gradual release of into circulation is used to distribute power in the ecosystem and can be by anyone according to their own As far as to coin transfer and use in the protocol exactly the same as That is and are globally available no one can censor as long as have their own private they have full control over their wealth This basically that people can rely on the particular of the network that come from decentralization and use that to their own advantage Does an unchanging monetary policy only make sense for or is it also important elsewhere From our perspective this feature or service is useful in many other a large user base that is eager to build more advanced For that they need their own platform and their own cannot be used to implement such a platform in principle therefore its own making the network completely independent of s fate The same can be said for individual built on the platform will be that have a limited number of It no sense for a service to be dependent on It s a smart idea to issue your own for a given project What if a country to issue its own currency and define its own monetary policy say with say inflation per year If the monetary policy is to be immutable some global network over which no one control must ensure exactly this It t matter what other the new will be transferred on What is that the are and unchangeable can be on the layer and that the rule that of new are each year What if the state needs to borrow more money in the case of crisis A rule can be prepared for this eventuality as well can lend to the state with the understanding that if the state does not repay on time the protocol will reduce the annual inflation of new adequately Notice how elegantly it works you to define that cannot be once they are in place It advantage of a first layer over which no third party control Not even the or can be used on other so they do not burden the network The network will only ensure that the number of or does not increase People can own the of a given state they will be able to verify authenticity easily but the state will have no control over monetary policy will be able to use the network to transfer at any time so possible censorship on the second layer no sense are unlikely to want to give up control over money so this example was kind of hypothetical However if a group of people in a given location to issue its money the possibility The industry to ensure that a given work a given token Ideally it that the work is indeed from the author and that neither the author nor anyone else subsequently the work If this it will be very easy to detect If the author a digital ID and the on the network will be able to verify the origin of the work and the authenticity of the The whether a physical image or a representation of a physical object will be by the owner of the no one else People will be able to easily distinguish the original from Even if anyone in the world a copy of the image or even their own the original will always be traceable and only that will be of the highest value People mainly associate with but a token can represent pretty much anything It t matter if it s a digital game a song an album a video a tweet access to content a ticket or a vote The important thing is that it some value to that group of people It t have to be economic value and liquidity does not need to be high People sometimes mistakenly think that if a token t grow in market value it no value That is a big mistake For example stable have stable power by design If you want to really own money not rely on a bank account and at the same time want to avoid the risk of volatility you have no choice but to start stable You will get all the of decentralization and no one will take your money away from you Why do the IT have so much control over Web these days One of the is that they have a monopoly on the provision of digital identity This them full control over user data and them to profit from it The IT know more about you than say and They may know more about your than you do Digital identity is also something that people can take back under their own control Anyone can stop the of the IT their service of providing to third The reality is that if there is no alternative no one will do it The only viable alternative must be built on a public key infrastructure where can be instantly by anyone anywhere Moreover it data through secure private peer to peer communication People don t realize how important their identity is in everyday life and how crucial the information associated with it is Many and social are built on the basis of the verifiability of the identity of the other party For the industry and Web the verifiable identity of is just as important as it is for Web The fundamental difference again in ownership When will we see Web Web is definitely a relevant effort but it is hard to predict when we will see adoption The industry is still in its infancy We more than from the launch of the first network to have a more scalable and sustainable consensus We have other and that s a good thing While technological progress is we estimate that the first globally successful Web will emerge in need to offer concrete to people Decentralization is a very powerful concept but from a marketing perspective it will never be the reason why people will want to join Web Current have a large user base and a strong network effect People first need to learn how to use which are the gateway to Web Fortunately this is happening People are from different and trying to send However this is not enough for mass success need to emerge that actually compete with Web Until is as reliable and visibly than from a bank people will remain loyal to the traditional world Perhaps all of today s large are watching the industry and beginning to understand the This is most evident in the industry Big have not been very interested in as money so their interest in is very surprising Twitter and many are looking for ways to leverage This is not just the of some alternative speculator community is becoming a serious industry These big will need to integrate their infrastructure with by large to create their own will always fail on decentralization If release their on and other public IT will have no choice but to adapt and settle for the fact that they will never fully own the infrastructure of public It can be that not only IT and many will start building some on However are often still not ready for the The team will need a few more before is more scalable The current enthusiasm may wane and it is possible that the big boom will not happen until from now However it is positive to see interest in from both and everyday people Conclusion is definitely a good platform to build Web on as it is one of the most currently Web is essentially all about that are born out of the of decentralization a strong community and there was a fair distribution of at the beginning It s a community project These will become increasingly important The technological readiness of will be key for Web is one of the in the space This the most project according to Technology needs to evolve and are no exception is being built to give people back control of their That s the original vision and it sense to strive to fulfill it The team will work on and get it ready for Web in a few","538":"Some say we might be heading into a

or some other politician or economist who was alive during ww not getting it as if it s a sign that we re still early your and life have no influence on whether you get it or not a lot of people are

he were alive today the politics are that different so it to reason many people have chosen to have an outdated and antiquated view of money that does not coincide with the new reality and nothing will change their mind not even a deluge of the most convincing and information the biggest truth we need to acknowledge is that not getting it t a sign that we re early it just they re late for

is being early to the idea individual don t matter the majority s opinion matter and the majority are very receptive to the idea of sound money why t they be when they re crushed by debt and inflation we need to stop thinking is this esoteric phenomena that no one people get it a lot of them just simply don t have the or access to technology to play around with it at this point and the reason is the window at which was early is in fact very small and it between its inception and around when the first major peak same with almost every other modern technology we now take for if you t buy stock

back to the grid does that provide the grid with what it needs to keep as normal This is a key test moment for the industry continued Whether going en masse in one of the biggest mining in the world will move the price of the answer is probably no The supply delta from the pace of mining is typically minimal and any price in or other major proof of work would likely have more to do with macro and overall risk off behavior WATCH NOW VIDEO A war is brewing among in the US to attract Big test for Many in the mining industry tell that the next few days are a high way of testing out whether the

throughout this first big test of the year continued That financial incentive is key are not altruistically to do the grid a solid by sometimes down some or all of its to free up electricity for those

power down And from s experience they get curtailment less than of the time in the course of a year which he comes to about five to ten a month Even that haven t cut a deal with sometimes voluntarily

grid not a help said Ben Hertz of Wood a provider of commercial intelligence for the world s natural sector Hertz is concerned that mining would only raise peak demand ultimately stress to the system Hertz that could more than double demand growth in s territory but unlike pro Republican Sen Ted Hertz t think that additional demand is a good thing The analogy I like to use is that if you start smoking two a day and then cut back to one pack on that t make smoking good for your health he Hertz that should be on grid to make it easier to get power from solar and wind to big consumption and that t the right way to deal with demand Instead he the intermittency of should be met with demand response from societally beneficial like industrial commercial and residential air or energy storage But interim Brad can be helpful been touring the state and hosting public to answer from about the electric grid Besides winter weather the impact of mining on the grid is a common question I m pro

one day the underlying file could be corrupted or I m together some research about a method to store on chain by of and their to save file information I guess we can call this a Native or something

the of their own token with an extra number at the front of the string to indicate which string in the sequential order of all it The will be linked together via a smart contract that it so when one

very beneficial for text based such as important that allow society to function such as identity and much more Furthermore once you have the data saved you can link the Native to other smart and have

people talk about it But it s not a piece of a company It s not gold silver or even It s an organizational system to keep score You choose which manifestation of a system you want to join though the basic infrastructure and are essentially identical and provide something of value to join Of course the actual number is essentially meaningless it to no more than some secret large prime number on

concept of this stuff and that is usually fine for most anyone s needs But there is always the rare case where trust are too and get burned like the Electrum v attack electrum Here I try to go through the minimal level of trust all the way down to the theoretical limit of what can be done At the heart of the matter is the concept of extended trust In most trust we start with something that more trust and see if we can connect it to something with less trust I walk through a few from the top down In general we will go through the following Trust the site Trust the Trust the compiler Trust the kernel Trust the hardware Trusting the site When such as core at a minimum it is important to ensure you from and not some site like If you grab from a sketchy site it may come with code to steal your See Electrum above In the realm of trusting the site there are those who trust the browser to get you to and who are more paranoid and will ensure that is enforced Unfortunately unless the site something like or other cryptographic domain verification you can just never be sure like and poisoning can get past even the best of security So can t be Trusting the In most trusting the is the what most recommend This process completely WHERE the were taken from even and instead rely on a builder s cryptographic signature with or in the file These are usually either or like Main here is that many user s don t know WHO the are In many most simply assume that a product must have a package owner builder A recent example of where this went horribly wrong was when ownership of a popular library was left to a contributor The new owner went about back to steal npmrepobitcoinstealer Since is interpretive it was quickly spotted but it the danger of new package or Clever like get around this problem by reproducible Reproducible are a way to design so that many community can each build the and ensure that the final installer built is identical to what other produce With a very public reproducible project like no single developer needs to be completely Many can all perform the build and attest that they produced the same file as the one the original builder digitally In most those who are not are fine to stop here Just insist that the you use is open source well reproducible with multiple who all attest to the same this test on all Trusting the compiler For those who may fear an evil cabal of or feel their project is not enough the next level down is to trust nothing but the compiler These will build the project from source code removing the need to trust the project Many may imagine that this is the furthest down the rabbit hole this topic can go but in actuality it t In a award speech the recipient Ken the question Should you trust your compiler He goes on to outline a method the Trusting Trust Attack Since even the most paranoid usually trust the compiler Ken the compiler is the perfect place to put your The of this attack are due to the fact that to make a new compiler binary you generally use the last compiler binary But what if compiler binary had malicious code to infect new This is particularly problematic since building goes back pretty far Android was made with that was made from Apple was made with and was made from These build go back So what if the original back in the s had a in the compiler that been carried forward for the last As involved as this there have been many proof of done to prove the attack s viability And with distrust of state security getting worse year after year it s not hard to imagine that some agency would want to pull off such attack The main attack surface here are what call the seed These are the previous of compiler and to build the next compiler If you can seed your build with a smaller set of then in theory you may get the set so small that examination for could look for bad code In version to the build system blob v for their official This reduced the weight of those seed from down to gnu bootstrap seed by The team is a new compiler build with a reduced seed weight of we did it That s a reduction of from the binary seed weight of v This claim is a bit hyperbolic but less than you might think The complier build a proto complier and a shell guile This reduction is only for not guile Though there is work to do the same reduction on guile that was done on but that may still be a few out Trusting the Kernel Implicit in the trust of the compiler is the trust of the kernel and OS that the compiler is running on So if a trusting trust decided to propagate and infect in both a compiler and kernel then reducing your binary seed may not be enough This is a harder attack to pull off since a seed build will likely be hand for the first few The would need to know to infect the process far enough along to where it t visible any more The solution to this is to bootstrap your compiler build without a kernel This can be done up until a point The hex assembler and macro assembler can be loaded directly out of a legacy think xC and work is ongoing in in the stage project that in the bootstrap But realistically I m not sure how far they can take this Trusting the Hardware if you could bootstrap without the kernel there is still the trust of the hardware A builder is trusting that the processor and instruction pipeline is not doing something malicious if it a compiler bootstrap is in place Although this is pretty deep paranoia people are still thinking about this stuff The reduced bootstrap is working to have a x and arm bootstrap independent of each other Although one can be cross on the other it was thought to be better if arm t have to trust x hardware for a bootstrap and vice tinfoilhatfud ELI watch v nslYsUc Reducing watch v IiShmUTEl Reduction watch v XvVWdDFI

meaningful to the average person Ever since its name to Meta my entire industry been The r qwr introductiontothemetaverse It was at first fascinating to see how many other people are passionate about the idea of virtual an important role in everyday life but then everything of of people to show up in the we would chat shilling and Initially I was curious and I saw that there were many massive in the technology however I fundamentally t understand how all these people would pull off their of a people first Web I thought to myself they re probably just a lot than I am After all with so many massive I probably just t understand So I to study and ask If anyone can create a virtual world what land scarce If will indeed be used for a large how would different virtual world integrate them And many more The more I the less I found the I dug the more disturbed I xB Rather than real to my with Don t listen to the FUD Fear Uncertainty and Doubt they would say and Believe in the don t worry about the I could see that they were star struck along by an unmoving faith in However very few people had real they just assumed someone else had fingered it out But why would so many people choose to close their and plug their t the entirety of western civilization built on fear uncertainty and doubt t how we got here So I to study What sort of future does Web pitch First we need to understand what the of Web preach Decentralization privacy A world where we will be in charge of our own identity and security in order to take back control from the Web like and An open Namely that the future of the is a group of large connected virtual in which anyone can create which many of those will be able to use Individual monetary control People being able to use the currency they believe in xB Decentralization Smith that as develop skilled specialize in smaller and smaller particular in order to increase their own efficiency Whereas one person could create an entire watch it was much more efficient for one person to focus entirely on the of the watch and the other on the of the watch In Web we all ran our own on our own and we all learned code in order to publish content on them In Web hosting our our and our identity and security were handled by them Each company specialized in providing a service to the and was to that service alone Web imagines a world which this flow We would once again be in charge of our own identity security and hosting What Web seem to miss is that Web was a natural improvement on Weband that the pitch of Web customer the wrong way around People want usability and people don t pay for privacy After all the put microphone camera in their pocket because it them get more time My exploration in these even me to question the viability of technology and as being fundamental to the future xB Privacy One of the Web is as the future is that we will be in control of our data However I that this decentralization so far only led to more being able to see our data Now with being an open visible immutable it s a total nightmare for privacy Anyone can see what we own and who we connect with Moreover because the is immutable anyone can send a picture of our front door to our address and now everyone that data Just imagine a world in which your nude are sent to your wallet address Web decentralization had a negative impact on privacy why would Web be different In thought the ideal is noble but in practice Web so far is the worst possible outcome for privacy xB I can t even begin to list the number of with this idea Style Each virtual world in the greater will have a different style this an sword from one world simply won t work in another world the style is pretty much like making the item new Trying to do this at scale with of is totally ridiculous Balance The virtual of the future will include some sort of and breaking that by of unbalanced is a bad idea Economy Each virtual world creator will be financially not to allow in the greater ecosystem of the because if they do they will undercut their own and their ability to sell their own Those who suggest that this will be ideal for marketing misunderstand why people adopt virtual in the first place Fit Most people are unaware that everything in a virtual world is fit to most other in it The size of is carefully to the size of you can put on The size of a that you can wear is carefully to make sure you don t clip through the you sit on Unless you imagine a world in which everybody is clipping through everything in a jarring immersion breaking experience it s just not going to work xB Virtual world The idea of are on an idea of a large We should keep in mind that the for more than via like Second Life and that the never adopted the technology I sincerely believe this is because of its lack of practicality in everyday and it s to the average person Here are some of the an A truly cannot impose on all Just imagine a world in which every virtual world creator their own One person will use the arrow another another mouse movement It s absurd to think that every time someone will pass from one place to another they will have to learn a new set of Those who are reading this must remember that we are the of computer Chrome added a copy and paste feature for those who did not understand how to do this via their keyboard and most are confused by how even something like works In my study of how people interact with virtual they see themselves as standing next to a big red button that if they push it it will blow up everything People are of what they don t understand In the there are real to not understanding for example which button you if you are talking to a human or what if you fall off this sky island to relearn everything about life every time you enter a world is absurd However that s how Web worked a new for every and space I believe the lack of usability is one of the average people stopped in large part the greater web and in on like and Web is we run this backwards in the name of freedom and privacy with no clear path and no particle on how to do this The leaky tap When everything is it s really hard to advance a standard One example is we been struggling to get to be for a very long time because everyone to adopt the same to make it work This same problem will put an series of virtual far behind a unified experience Individual virtual world are very likely to see how the virtual world should work in different ways I sincerely believe that humanoid are key but other people are intent on people to dress up as With that sort of diversity the understandability of the will be very low and make large scale adoption a challenge Traversal At some point a single virtual world platform is likely to amass a large number of for one reason or another This would give them the opportunity to engage in sizable platform like and Apple do with the Store If one world gains the familiarity of of millions of would they be highly to share that traffic with everyone else If a large portion of the population of the becomes familiar with platform t they more likely to coalesce on that platform due to the fact that they already put in the effort to understand it the idea that one platform will get a bulk of the and share them is unlikely All of these stand in opposition to a large upon which the value of is and they also make a situation more likely If a uniform is to appear will it give up it s right to massive platform to allow in without those paying a massive tax The would undermine one of the platform s most lucrative Individual monetary control Note There are probably more qualified people here who can comment on this International trade often through the United The United is the home of a global reserve currency which everyone needs and everyone and is the standard to most economic of the modern world Ever since moving off the gold standard the United the ability to print a very large quantity of money and use this as a subtle global tax on those who use the US dollar Since the US dollar a global demand printing huge is easy since the impact is spread out across the whole world The true value of a currency is in the goods that can be in that currency As long as everything goes through the US the US can keep printing However if a viable alternative is found the US will no longer be able to tax the world Some interesting by Jake be TPuBmuYa be TPuBmuYa Watch that video There s a lot I d like to say on this topic but I don t feel entirely comfortable doing it but I will highlight When the United saw gold as an issue they used Executive Order in to force US to trade gold for cash When known for its massive user base and usable tried to create a anyone could use it was shut down as fast as lightning So if the government can stop people even gold at will what them from stopping or If the government could shut down s so quickly why t it shut these down What if they understood was so broken that they don t see it as a threat What if the gas unstable price and total lack of usability by the average user was so bad the US does not fear it There is a lot more to than functional currency use but I am only that one subject I have much more to say but cannot say it here Conclusion Those of us who work in the virtual world industry are dealing with a whole new paradigm of human behavior Many of these and strongly those who buy in to blindly shill a product without scrutiny as everyone is looking for a bigger buyer to buy their land or currency This new marketing paradigm combined with social media amplification and bot driven is something we as a human species are going to have to wrestle with Here is what I believe we need to do Ask don t believe other people have figured it out Don t judge and condemn people for being adjacent to or the Seriously we must stop banning these on as that a bigger echo chamber Don t advocate for something you have a deep financial interest in without that It s deeply unethical No one a monopoly on truth We cannot follow the herd whether it is for or against Web We must think for ourselves and be willing to share our to have them Taking Action I d love to team up with people who believe in a people first to create a future that on truly I believe will make a mass adoptable possible but there s a high chance the space will be dominated by a single company based on my above analysis This company will end up being responsible for our speech and therefore will be forced to use our data to censor us sometimes in advance like does on it s platform today If the if the future of how we live we need to avoid that outcome at all me form if you want to help out in this vision Right now I am looking to

appreciate some from Imagine a word where a network let s say but it on a high level to or any other network too is really widely adopted Everyone it your house ownership is by an your stock portfolio is on the of of worth of assets are locked in The whole nine Security of these assets are paramount What do you need to do to secure such a network from malicious specifically if now we are considering potentially state level These might see the akin to the electricity grid of another country they see it as a political military objective Normally the argument is that no one would invest enough to create havoc around trying to delay prevent consensus among the and so on because why would you do that if it in the collapse of the underlying assets and hence your own investment But some might not care about that see above So anyway the point is that what the from today is the cost of a Not going into the there are multiple you need to consider hardware cost electricity cost current number of you want to retroactively change with your attack but just simply that it s somewhere between billion for either or today Let s make it billion That if you have billion and you don t care about losing it you could actually do certain today This actually sense smaller are often getting like Classic so this is not a theoretical thing But here my problem question billion might sound a lot but it s really not that much for a state actor especially if we go back to our opening scenario where the world exploded and everyone or for example and the of locked in vital non fungible too as above property ownership So in order to protect that network you need to make sure the attack more than billion The way that is that hash rate of the network so an attacker needs to spend more to obtain enough of that to cause havoc But the of a network ONLY if the underlying asset price or too Why Because the block are constant so you will only have more if the smaller slice of due to more are by the fact that the block are worth more Same thing for Proof of Stake in order to protect a proof of stake network the underlying asset let s say when it goes proof of stake needs to be high enough to prevent someone with a real lot of money just to buy up half or more of the total supply But there are real with all this for example the more pow is used the more it will cost more electricity more hardware to secure the network how is this supposed to scale So if the chain times more value than today then we would need spend billion every year just to secure it Then trillion per year if usage times again the more a proof of stake network let s say is used the more the the price of need to grow that s the only way to secure the network but that t scale or sense either as a coin is not supposed to represent the total value locked in the system price is not number of in existence price is supposed to be the value that is with the utility price the utility of someone the network In other just because someone an on that the ownership of a really high value asset let s say the of a billion company decide to use to prove their ownership or whatever t mean that the price will reflect that directly But if is t reflect that directly then how is the network secure enough to protect those assets Like literally think about what would happen today if people to represent real world expensive assets like real estate Few of those in itself might be worth more than the billion it would cost to attack today Long story short can someone help me understand how pow or t matter supposed to scale up their security in case the network is really taking off and real world expensive assets","1262":"Wouldnt a wallet and the it from Every device be the way to keep your money

adoption is in and everyone also that the main steam does not trust It is seen as either gambling speculation or a scheme This is with good reason as it is all those and much much more So how do we get the adoption we want Regulation That is what some people say because as long as is a kind of unregulated wild west people are not going to feel secure My answer to this question is fairness Fairness is not something that is commonly considered in the financial community There is a conceptual framework in finance that should determine everything and as long as someone is not openly stealing in a specifically illegal fashion that basically all and are if you can get away with them Yet we have seen time and again how people at the top of the financial food chain manipulate the market in a myriad of ways not the least of which is just their large media power and of as nuclear in the market against retail who only have their bare to defend themselves with The whole story of comes to mind More than half of people who have money in stocks think the market is against individual according to a survey from Given the Information Asymmetry Education After trading Access to Capital Political Influence and that require full time work expensive equipment and of how can such a system be fair for working people trying to build wealth In many other of human endeavor such as sports you will note that people care a great deal about fairness In there are different or different starting for of different In boxing and martial there are by weight and sex I propose a similar system for a new currency platform That is that people should be divided up into different by so that we do not have minnow s in the same pool as and Why Because we have to be fundamentally different than the financial system which currently no one An Individual only tiered Public Coin for wealth building Essentially I propose a tiered coin system that would be usable only by and each individual could only be at one investment wealth level at a time IE are in the lightweight class and heavy would be against other in their own class As you build wealth you move from tier to tier and as you build you gain experience and are exposed to more complicated and manipulation among of the same level One primary goal would be to disallow all from this public coin and earmark it for private individual use only One account per person tied to a social security number or other ID system Essentially a replacement for what an account does now to help people build wealth but in the sphere can play in all the other of the world of finance but not here thus much of the manipulation from this individual only coin market Manipulation which advantage of less experienced people as we all know the goal is to let people build wealth among their without coming in and beating the snot out of light simply because they can KEY an like wealth building account for the economically with no entrance fee and no requirement of a job with k which many do not have Each person would only be a single account in this system and each single account can only occupy a single tier at a time no professional stay in the main financial where they reside now This would also tend to eliminate some of the volatility in the market as no would be doing margin trading and other high finance with large of liquidity Only exposed to people with similar experience and capital wealth and retirement building in an easy to understand way by When you gain enough capital you are automatically onto the next currency tier to compete with at your level The power to control each tier remains in the of the people at that tier Public Coin Level Minnow flyweight Minimum Maximum cap Level Carp bantamweight Minimum Maximum cap Level Eel Lightweight Minimum Maximum cap Level Piranha welterweight Minimum Maximum cap Level Shark middleweight Minimum Maximum cap Level light heavyweight Minimum Maximum cap Level Whale heavyweight Minimum Maximum cap Over million and your leaves the system and you are forced to exit the market via stable coin and play in the main forever The and are all just and can be to a better system The goal is to have a tiered system so that people compete in that match their level of wealth and experience This could be in many ways besides a system which weight classes in boxing but for of analogy I used something commonly understood That is the basic idea We need to separate out the unfair advantage from the market that and have so regular people have a fair chance to build wealth for retirement without the ridiculous advantage that people who understand math and high fiance gain and correspondingly the advantage those with mercenary and zero sum morals have to manipulate the complex that the average person can never hope to understand or compete with Why should we let heavy beat the piss out of light in any system Why should the old compete with the young Why should the highly educated compete with the totally inexperienced Is that fair And who truly from such a system t such a system take from the many and give to the one by design t that the opposite of a free market Does such a system encourage innovation not for the betterment of humanity but instead towards the mercenary plundering of wealth to the most voracious of math t such a system emphasize innovation and evolution of more and more insidious by which people with less skill can be by whose are so complex it of study to even understand As evolution of these sharkish move forward at breakneck speed will wealth inequality grow and Are we re the same caste system based on a tyranny of finance math I challenge those with the education and to create some place for fairness in our

have to deliberately opt out of aggregation This then small pool aggregation default to and a public statement that small are welcome and can succeed in This in the long run will greatly benefit decentralization To summarize if you had say small each with million thus a total of million they could aggregate together as a sort of composite pool of million Thus the composite pool million with respect to who will process the next block If a composite pool is chosen to produce a block then a small pool within the composite pool will produce the block but ALL within the composite pool will

solve this I m talking post a hypothetical mass adaption phase If it does play out this way then great People who got on board before have generational wealth But we look at this thing and extrapolate based on current of monetary theory and current central banking Let me try and explain my on this Year is xxx is over and done with It is the world reserve currency Barring for authoritarian nation who have its use the world in Modern have become defunct as no one needs to purchase via fiat conversion Everyone and of it By this point many have or experienced first hand the of self custody Some are responsible enough for this many are not People want to act in their self interest so they store their with who are via the modern equivalent of have their fiat with and operate under this new paradigm born prior to the adoption have born after have not They must earn and accumulate their own stack But they also must purchase the other assets they need to live that are perpetually more expensive than their modest wage can afford to buy outright They need to borrow now to afford the they need now So they borrow from one of these The institution then the funds for the purchase Great But now the consumer is paying a fixed loan that is increasingly expensive in relative until maturity During this their decrease in nominal in response to deflation maybe negative interest or reverse balloon style solve this But These have limited supply of hard to do this They need to lend now in order to receive future to satisfy demand for credit Eventually they run out and begin causing credit liquidity in the market since there is no other reserve asset So these get creative They start out they don t have that their future while progressively smaller will have a market value sufficient to keep them solvent They are based on their status trustworthiness to do this to some satisfactory ratio set by the market central bank whatever that like in the future are running smoothly But then some calamity the world War famine pandemic climate issue and now someone needs to raise funds in the now to pay for current needs Current reserve don t allow for this so the local regional world lower these until they are or even negative issue anti adjust to raise the liquidity to get through this crisis Short term this works but to faster deflation Wages shrink in relation to this I m sure you can figure out how the rest of this game goes from here The of the legacy fiat system are still there but in a deflationary sense instead of inflationary It is just done with a harder more democratic medium You end up just trading a system of that become worth less overtime for a system of that becomes worth more over time but functionally harder to stack Modern central banking and governmental of monetary policy arose from an inflationary capital system To think this won t happen in a deflationary system naive It remains to be seen how a deflationary currency will truly affect supply and demand on a global scale but I don t think assets that are currently out of reach over time credit will become a thing of the past I believe in as much as the next guy So stack now for the inevitable future But It s analogous to the industrial revolution and modern capitalism causing unforeseen in the future as the free market into the system we have today If we want this system to be the solution we know it can be we have to start thinking about this now The old system was good until it was Protect the in the long run let s start out what this thing needs to be to protect it from future The time is now not when panic in That s how we got here in the first place I just want like most of us who get it to try our best to really get it before it s too late the potential to fail if

sought after commodity collectible This alone is going to be the talk of the town for every person who any sort of investment And if you don t own at least one full you are not part of the cool club Not only that but you have new and more affordable mass production of housing Soon I feel you will be able to buy a house off of for less then k that they will come set up for you in two days This will make housing Less desirable as an asset to hold your money in Because affordable housing will now be the new thing available to practically anyone in or so will be the only asset that cannot be In fact it s so rare that people will eventually own it as art Anyone who money will eventually want to own one at all cost It s going to be more psychological than anything a will give you a status

men as strong men were universally productive men to produce anything as they were frequently or strong men lazy as following constantly productive men was hard work Therefore the strong men made an innovation they to productive men they would cease if they provided a fraction of their goods annually and even better to provide protection against other strong men The productive men accepted this as they could finally live in peace without fear of violence and focus on their own Naturally that was a lie This is how the first were as well the taxation and this was the story of human race until invention of Before no matter was it a Emperor a Caliph or a Feudal Lord the strong men could always raid the productive men seize their earthly goods and tax them with impunity In wrote the state literally tortured their all in order to gain all private precious in their and the productive men could only protest by not being productive hence the state eventually fell all of this breaking the cycle of mankind the government seizing the assets of their cannot be forged copied nor It cannot be taxed restricted or With the state is to prove they actually have the wealth they claim to hold

me thinking on what this model might look like and how the structure could work in the future Here s an example house valued at to sell but no one saved to buy expectation are that is deflationary so now future power Needs to sell though Financial intermediary in I don t say bank but you could read that here a contract basically the right to sell his house through a mortgage to be out over some term The discount is percent analogous to seller paying now Don t take the too seriously They would probably structure in some payment way offering more up front and gradually reducing the as time goes to buy a house He only saved He to buy house but needs a loan He goes the bank that the contract to buy house and to buy for some amount Let s say He down down payment A contract for repayment is set up probably a similar structure to with it costing more annual in the beginning and less so towards the end sold house really getting a passive income stream for the right to sell bought a house closer to a traditional mortgage Both are happy Bank the difference between and contract plus difference between interest in both But why would take on the risk of the intermediary not paying him This is where negative come into play They pay him for his risk by paying him interest to sell his house Let s say If s rate to buy is then they make If bank repossess home and If intermediary by this version of mortgage insurance for his contract The world works as normal float between these an are on the hook for large of they may or may not have We can verify with But as long as cash are good they are profitable so no one until there is trouble in the market Market shoot up or plummet interest accordingly same as before Yes people could just pay up front and not take out They could do that now some do most don t but it will be harder and harder to stack in an deflationary model Just saving up for big t an option for most But this model still us in the same boat we are in with bank liquidity and market causing and The will be forced to step in like in the past So how is deflationary inflationary different unless we solve these kind of first This works for but personal or

and be done with it Then they found out it t going to be that easy and had to redo their original design Was that the case for you We first did research and found out even before writing a single line of code or design document that the model of with a single liquidity pool would not be straightforward For us the model that made sense the most from and complexity perspective was the model Since then it become the standard way to interact with a single piece of data on Every exchange needs to get asset from somewhere with reliability Where will get them from In an model the exchange rate is defined by the ratio of the in the pool In the presence of the pool s exchange rate should converge to the market rate People debate the between the accounting model used by and the model used by Both are different and have their Is the model suitable for The model is an excellent fit for order book type on the other hand bring a more friendly experience but are more to get right on the technical side Turns out borrowing some design like from the order book model does make it feasible to do also This is where our development come in handy When smart were on a lot of people were talking about

time you sell out you let the rich back in the game Material riches do not mean It s all about the people and about the power People give meaning to life The power that we all crave is the power to have freedom and choice and power to protect those that we love After you sell out everything going back to the way it was The past are completely unique in human history maybe never to repeat Do not

you a library written in Python It to create and sign without depending on third party serialization such as input output node and serialization serialization making it a lightweight library which is simple and fast to set up in all of The goal of this project is to enable to write off chain code and test their in pure Python Nevertheless we see the potential in expanding this project to a full node client which could be beneficial for faster R D You can already use the library to transfer funds and mint In fact I recently used it to distribute loyalty to my All loyalty were sent in one transaction and it only cost in fee probably nothing P Please look at this example blob main delegatorloyaltyrewards to learn how it was done Also there is a example blob main nativetoken if you want to learn about how to mint your own The next big feature to be worked on is integration something similar to Application It will allow to write simple Python code to interact with This is also the initial reason why I an easy to use tool in my favorite language to develop Will have an update once it is out please stay tuned If you are a Python developer and interested in something on please try out the library I can t wait to hear your and Also any contribution to the project is more than welcome You can find the development guide here development xB Q How is different from other python such as python python and input output Previous have hard on other serialization such as node and wallet and running these locally a good amount of time and space and additional to maintain and upgrade them t depend on those external Simply running a pip install command and you are all set xB Q What audience is this library for and what can I do with it Any developer or with Python experience You can use the library to create transfer funds and mint A complete list of could be found here Also this folder tree main some useful usage xB Q Does this library work with light e g Absolutely With this library you can create an unsigned transaction and get its binary which could be sent from your application to the wallet Then the wallet will sign and submit the transaction to the network xB Q Can you write script on chain code with this library Unfortunately not a the moment On chain code will still need to be written in until we see a prototype of from Verification or a Python core compiler However the good news is that on chain code is usually shorter less complex and change less frequently than off chain code which you can still benefit a lot e g save a lot of time in learning

regulated market in the world They t finance the construction of the ledger with of They the creation of the ledger through traditional There is a long paper trail that this They don t sell below market just to make a buck This is an erroneous FUD because of the R Ripple deal that went to court They did sell into the secondary but completely stopped when the wash trading controversy a few ago where were across most So selling by volume hurt the market so they stopped They built the ledger with in place to decentralize over time and completely release it into the wild when the community had grown enough around its use that a shepherd was no longer This is still in progress but close to completion we are in stage currently In stage it will be control There are now several by stake that have as little as overlap with The biggest reason why I support and by extension Ripple is because the suite of Ripple and the permissioned public liquidity network built on top of the is designed to fix a lot of the inherent in our financial system The interbank liquidity are by just a handful of US They are private that completely control the in the world When a small or medium sized financial institution interest bearing financial they re immediately sold into the interbank where they go up the food chain to the They receive monthly on this debt a web of debt throughout our financial

drawn out debate to me the ability to maintain anonymity prevent cluster is pretty essential to whether or not I consider to become a viable currency You may feel that t so important but let s assume for the sake of my question it is as I am mainly wondering about how this all actually works Do resolve this dilemma I don t understand how it would even be possible to trace an address that is only ever used a single time to an individual That is assuming other are taken to hide other identifiable information such as by Tor or some other Basically it that the only way to actually consistently tie random to an individual is some sort of consistent information that t on the This would be good It is manageable But the part I m not certain on is whether that would even matter if someone is able to tie a single address that you only use once back to you if they can t then use that one instance to follow the rest of your and for instance find out how much you hold in your primary cold wallet where you hold all your If you re an wallet or just manually change address for next transaction t it be impossible to continue tracing that Sure they figured out one but then they d have to do it for the next one and the next one and the next one so they re not any sort of traceable link at all just it on a case by case basis Which without something really obvious like address of your device you clearly own I don t see how it s possible to consistently Am I missing something here Are specific or of them individually identifiable so that you can actually follow the transaction history of a specific So for instance let s say I use an intermediary wallet on my phone to accept and then I have my cold wallet on my to store all my money for safekeeping If I were to move a small payment into my intermediary wallet then to later move that same amount into my cold wallet and every transaction used burner only used a single time you d still be able to tell I was the owner of both of those after enough like that Or say that those I m on my phone wallet are regular from the same person Despite random and single use for each transaction it would still be possible to identify these regular come from the same person to the same person and not just random that coincidentally are happening at similar Which could then be used in a cluster string to identify more personal not

meant The economy is still very reliant on the fiat on and off need to work towards a circular economy where you don t buy you get in and you don t sell you trade goods and for it Looking for to move towards the circular economy I came across a great Fountain Fountain works just like any other but it a lightning wallet When content claim their on Fountain they can link a lightning node and can stream to them while they stream content to their This is the value for value model that should be looking for Where content can cut out any middleman and can support the content they like directly with as little as sat min Right now there are mostly that have the lightning feature but anyone a can claim their content and start I think we should start to encourage content to switch to a value for value model with I have out to some to let them know that I want to support them with but they haven t their content in Fountain yet Hopefully they will see the value in being funded directly from their with no rd party able to disrupt their ability to produce and share content Especially with all the censorship and banning going on these days Its now becoming clear that corporate news are losing their monopoly on information and becoming more desperate to eliminate competition Even worse have been helping legacy media censor and ban their They do this by going after their ability to finance their content usually by getting to pull support Switching to a value for value model the content you support t go away but it s important to have that system in place when if you support get cut off from We must start moving to this value for value model now so we do not have another situation like with the trucker convoy We want to be leading the charge against fiat and all its corruption not simply just to it and it all works out At the very least switch to Fountain simply to get away from big tech like Apple or other that are pro censorship Let know you want to support

power to respond I don t think on the nature of your opposition is a winning strategy to rule of law as the arbiter can take or to release funds if ever So how to finance peaceful resistance may be a harder problem to solve than most imagine Here are some common ways that those with power can silence those without Coercion The obvious pressure is simply coercion where public pressure or of audit may cause to pull The donation site may be steadfast but that is not always a guarantee Social Media Revocation Donation site with social media could easily be frozen by Twitter There are a few social media that may help and those should definitely be in your distribution and I believe a network Browser The next major dependency are the three Chrome and Safari All three maintain an Unsafe Site list that these could easily be added to if those browser choose to do so CA Revocation Moving down the line donation often use a certificate authority If the CA bowed to pressure they could revoke the site s certificate It would be similar to a browser Revocation Donation often use large domain like I know no problem registration for any site or cause that they are to remove Web Network Hosting Even if Let s Encrypt and the choose to ignore social pressure unless a donation site is housing their own network edge and server infrastructure whichever company their and server hosting could pull the plug If you manage to get through all the censorship and do amass fund spending those funds can be problematic Pressure can be put on and to prevent FIAT from being withdrawn or prevent from finding an off ramp So with all the danger s outlined I go through some of the I don t endorse any of these just outline what is out there payment blob master for a type of key swap voodoo where a base string payment code similar to an can be on your site The protocol for a key that will privately peer to peer produce an agreed on address that the owner of the payment code The key space for all that can be made is So it would be very difficult for an entity to enforce a that large In short cannot be I believe Samurai are the only one s supporting either send or receive to presently Web Archive Whether you self host your donation site or use a donation service ensure you have web archive crawl your site archive and archive today are two of the web a copy of your donation page with the BIP payment code will help prevent complete censorship But keep in mind archive WILL take off the archive if ordered to do so archive today is a bit more in their Mirror You may not need to commit to or for donation best to put the same base donate file on all three Best to include a BIP payment code on your template Self Host As you further down the list self hosting becomes important The main problem with self hosting is protection since most any single server can trivially be taken Also on any service like is problematic since can easily remove if to do so later is probably the best resistant self hosting solution Social Take some time to find some social I know and used to both be partially or fully peer to peer Another for would be like Signal are good but since they rely on phone they could likely revoke access if Server Just like self hosting many of the in the hosting stack server many of the in the payment stack One of the great with is that it clean hosting of These are quasi anonymous so should be when will also accept alt coin Unfortunately neither BIP or support is available in today Alternate Onion IP Given how much centralization is in most IPv or IPv some and better have come to light IP Onion and are three such of network Each with their own and is nice since any user can pin your site So something as simple as a single donate site pinned throughout the network would become unstoppable IP is similar but the pinning is implicit based upon how often the information is A major drawback to these is that hosting back end like won t work Onion is the only alternate network that would work with Cleaning Since most any non BIP shielded address could be you should anticipate cleaning any you receive like Wasabi Whirlpool and can help your These are definitely so take a moment to learn how to manage and insulate clean so that they don t mingle If your left with too small to tumble you can use a non to exchange Something like would likely work But

who already a backlog of that you could turn into an then this step will take no time at all This also goes for who have content produced or who have a strong handle on Adobe Suite However if you don t have a design background or don t have anyone who may want to be involved in the project that does there are where you can find to help for a cost Designer them for Designer them for Fiver Depending on what you want the price can start at as little as Upwork Hourly rate based of per hour for a designer Before going to these and sending it s important to have the following penciled down otherwise you re wasting your time and the This t mean you need to know every single detail but a general idea of the below will make this process A LOT easier for both Style of design you like gather some inspiration visit Your budget Keep in mind there are other for The amount of s you want to create Choosing a Now that you have your art ready it s time to mint it and put it up for sale For this you need an that the of your choice There are a few when looking for the right fit so and are great starting One of the biggest between and the rest would come down the gas security and active You can find previous at that provide great insight into the on these and where may suit best for your collection How much should I charge There are some that contribute to this and it s not always an easy task If you re new to the space it s better to start at a lower price Once you have established yourself you can increase the of your future or The golden rule most follow is to never mint their if the gas are more expensive than the itself Many also offer extra for such as membership land exclusive merch and among In such too you can price your higher this is a little more advanced but content are looking to build in access to their so it s still relevant in some an is how your digital art becomes a part of the a public ledger that is unchangeable and tamper proof Each will have its own to mint Here are the basic you have to follow Create a digital file of your art and make sure the file format is by your of choice Create an account on the connect your wallet and click the create option this may be different depending on the your file give a name and description and add and unlockable content if available Lastly click create and you are all set The other alternative is Lazy Put simply lazy is when an is available off chain and only once there is a sale of the This that the artist t have to pay any gas to mint their Another way to look at lazy is to see it as a way to defer the payment of gas until the is sold This really only sense though if you are going to use as gas can be very at times Hope this a solid idea of and when an or collection and vary so you will need to

not much response or serious discussion people here are more interested in one line post with no content Anyway I will share another thing I observe that will harm a lot of retail I am relative new to but I have a background from finance Twitter been a major source of information and analytics source for me There are of gold in twitter but there are also of misinformation intentionally or unintentionally I can assure you that of analyst on twitter never studied economics and never worked in finance or may not even have intensive experience in stock and in short they don t know what they are talking about You may realize most of them focus on so TA technical analysis There is nothing wrong with TA But you have got to understand that the reason they are ONLY doing TA is because they dont understand anything else and TA is not as difficult as you think But I have major here TA is right of the time of the time there is no professional all earth rely solely on TA it does not work TA is a good reference if you do it right but solely rely on it DOES NOT WORK Pure TA research is very very rare in traditional finance very rare I can think of still a small team doing that but I dont think other major have them TA is useful when you do it RIGHT Sadly half of them do it wrongly You can spot a when they don t even have volume turned on on their so what are you to be The is be very careful to these free information do your own research and do not allow other people frame your expectation You have to have your own idea an educated guess based on your knowledge experience and your research I can tell you a lot of them ended up a analyst or influencer because they might have the previous cycle intentionally or unintentionally or they want to leave their job and write newsletter profiting from their To some extend they act like they are here to make money your money regardless of going up or down A red flag of a typical poor analyst would be those that continue to call ever single short term move also those that are with so wave counting should be very carefully wave theory is sort of a joke most people disregard it but somehow it is very popular in the space again my guess is its something you can learn yourself and it fancy and technical when you pull a wave count graph the Recommendation do your own research try to go for the who build his her own model analyse on chain data focus less on those who predict short time fame move or produce fancy wave count It is you can be profitable as a TA guy in the s because computer was a new thing but not today Take advantage of the correction period to get more education always take information recommendation you see with a grain of salt Behavior economics is a great subject to study you will benefit tremendously Remember have a view it t matter whether you are right or wrong but your own view and reasoning to back it up is how you can evaluate yourself later this is learning and I am learning

promise of rolling our additional and utility that will unfold over time They would then run off with the money well before any of those can take place In it s common to see a project or token knowing it s worthless one in which they hold assets When their audience to buy it they sell into that spike in or token price essentially leaving the new high and dry with an asset that is now worthless The

a wallet and you revoke This t reimburse you but it may help in this happening again or provide a slight chance to stop the hacker before he a chance to set his plan in motion Question everything and

the waiting to rug you to ask before in would be What is their reputation in the space the project been by a reputable auditor is usually the best Have they worked on successful in the past What s their track record Who is the artist Does the art translate well How active are the community and what type of discussion are being had You find A LOT of get to endorse or promote bad One great example was Jake who a pump and dump Even if the celebrity it like they re personally involved in the project Be extremely cautious Lastly be prepared to lose everything This one is super simple in my opinion but many refuse to acknowledge this simple guideline Only invest what you can afford to lose If you can comfortably have that money sitting in an asset for or longer knowing that all your and won t suffer then it s probably a safe amount This goes for everyone That feeling you get in your stomach when your or fail to provide any return that s the feeling of someone who more than they could afford to lose Don t be that person The other great rule is to NEVER invest in anything that you don t truly understand That s literally gambling There is a difference between Poker and roulette One

general and the the team It is interesting to see which the team and which design were made The evolution of still dominate trading with digital assets These hold control over private exchange trading user information fund security and exchange ratio These do not offer a secure passive income for coin or token Traditional use the so order book model can submit their buy or sell and a central market maker During the matching of buy and sell a specific matching strategy must be Once a match is found trade between the two can be executed This is a very basic concept of two assets between an order book can offer two of A market order a user to sell A for the desired amount of B The user must take into account the current market of the The user the market order to be executed almost immediately The second type is a limit order where the user A for the desired amount of B but the exact price at which the trade is to be executed The limit order can thus be pending for a longer period of time until market approach the user s Finance given the world a different perspective on trading and demonstrably better for offer a non custodial solution fair treatment lower anonymity global availability for everybody and of and to take advantage of passive income A completely fundamental innovation is the Market Maker model based on model provide trading of assets through execution of smart User swap are executed completely automatically and there is no need to rely on a third party The model so liquidity You can think of a liquidity pool as a collection of two of For example a collection of A and another collection of B make one liquidity pool do not require the buyer and seller matching no matching Instead of that can simply exchange their and assets liquidity Thus swap can be basically immediately set the price of based on a ratio in liquidity A user swap request is always directed to a given pool identical A typical exchange multiple liquidity For example if it trading in A B and C it can have There will be with the following A and B A and C B and C In order to be able to execute on the exchange it is necessary to have enough in the In other need sufficient liquidity Token can provide this liquidity to the and thus become so liquidity Liquidity typically deposit both of for a given pool This for example a liquidity provider needs to deposit worth and A also worth for a pool with the pair and token A Liquidity are for providing The reward is proportional to the liquidity provided and is taken from the for executed As a member of the team is a modern approach to trading in a world and become the new standard It is the most convenient way to exchange With the adoption of we can expect to routinely hold many of and in their and These will have some value and can profit if they provide the to an exchange There is a wonderful symbiosis between and liquidity with both from the existence of the service That is why the will be based on the model Understanding and the of building on Before we look at some of the of the design it s important to understand the between the ecosystem and Many have tried to take a that been already running on and copy the design in order to have quickly built in the ecosystem These soon that this was the wrong way to go and that they to think more about the design The team the development of The team many of experience with the ecosystem of and with the team The team was able to avoid many from the very beginning and designed correctly on the first try Let s explain the between and to better understand the that face This you understand why you can t just copy a concept from the ecosystem Each network is trying to reach a network consensus over in ownership of and In other each new block the state In the industry there are two widespread ways to work with Each way its and The first is Unspent Transaction Output which The second is the Account based model which but also other like The team an extended version of Extended the use of smart In this article we will continue to use the term but in the context of it is s account based model is similar to a bank account are on and represent the current Every transaction When a user a given number of to another user the account of the sender is and the account of the recipient is It is an atomic operation a global state across all Each new transaction the global state During every single change the global state is locked It is important to understand that depend on each other and their order in the block The outcome of higher uncertainty and it is not deterministic To validate a block it is necessary to know the order of The validation of must be done step by step As a result parallelization is very difficult since every transaction in a new block must be in the context of previous and made the global state is also possible by smart which can modify the s design the advantage for application of not to worry about concurrency can freely work with user and change the balance Because it is that are individually there is less risk of two the same balance at the same time Thus it is relatively easy to design an application The are the complexity of parallelization frequently and to pay a fee even for that fail Moreover due to the of there is an issue known as Miner Extractable Value s significantly from s account based model You can think of as If you imagine your physical wallet as a address you could have more in it more If a user to know the total number of at an address it would be to sum up the value of all Spending works the same way as with If the user a with a value of and she needs to pay then will leave the address and will be added to the recipient address and will come back to the sender address As a result there will be two we From the ledger perspective a transaction and where the are unspent from previous Notice that we are still talking about Assets are on the ledger in unspent rather than in Remember that each can only be once and as a whole Transaction validation is much simpler in the network In the model only the local state is important It that the outcome of the transaction only on the use of which are immutable single use that act as the input and output of Thus are independent of each other and there is nothing like the global state The big advantage is that the validity of a transaction can be checked off chain before the transaction is sent to the If the transaction the local validation e g in the user s wallet there is a high probability that on chain validation as well and the transaction it into the block A node could in principle validate in parallel if those do not try to consume the same input The high level of determinism and parallelization are of the design On the other hand as the member of the team have to deal with concurrency themselves Each can be only once and it must be by the whole network It technically that can be once per a given block can run into contention if they depend on the same at the same time If some funds were locked by a smart contract only a single actor can interact with it inside one block As you can see and are two completely different We the team what they have for building and how they work with smart on In some way is somewhat analogous to pay to script hash functionality where the transaction is by a script Unlike in the case of you can attach additional data Datum to Datum is arbitrary like data are by a triplet address value and optionally a Datum The address can be derived from a public key or it can be the address of a script In the case of the script address the can only be spent if the validation defined in the associated script you to write program logic in two distinct Firstly there is an on chain part that writing a validation script are by so this part the by traditional smart Secondly it is an off chain part that a business logic for building in accordance with the associated on chain Both on chain and off chain logic can be written in However can use any language for the off chain part On chain and off chain are not necessarily dependent on each other and do not form a single unit can be by the off chain and define contract So a can be spent by a transaction that is not necessarily by the off chain part If the in the validation script are satisfied then the is spent As the member of the team the business logic could even be as a part of or tightly coupled with on the front end During the execution a validation script with Datum Redeemer and context that transaction data As we said the Datum is attached to Redeemer is a user specific argument that is provided in the transaction which was to spend the In general the redeemer can serve different It can be as a user intention the transaction creator on how to spend the How to design The first on In the beginning liquidity was low on It was not a good situation for classic order book Eventually the idea of liquidity popular The account based model is well for this as liquidity can essentially be just these to be arbitrarily within a block from the success of the concept We the team how to design on and which they to overcome In interact with the liquidity pool atomically swapping and the liquidity pool This simple design cannot be copied and applied to A liquidity pool is essentially a resource as multiple try to use it at the same time If the liquidity pool was as a single in a naive way to create something like balance only a single swap could be executed per block Any other would fail After every swap a new liquidity pool would have to be with the balance How to make a swap on the based ledger It is necessary to have a set of available from which can be taken and another set of into which can be inserted The swap could be in such a way that individual would consume from one set and insert on the other side of the set The swap is via the exchange of selected have to provide with one type of token that will stay in the liquidity pool to receive with the second type of token At this point as we can see we encounter a challenge for on They have to come up with some business logic to ensure that individual don t try to use the same in the pool within a block This is tricky because the are independent of each other Without some or clever algorithm may try to use the same but only one can succeed The goal for is obvious How to achieve many with a single liquidity pool by different in one block The member of the team explaining We basically see two to tackle concurrency in brute force and bulk The brute force strategy limited and usage scope As across the platform the concurrency issue would become an extreme bottleneck The team decided to use the second strategy bulk The bulk strategy the interaction with smart into two phases In the first phase the user needs to create a swap request When the user the transaction the are locked at the script address the under which the can be spent In the second phase it is the turn an agent is also a batcher search for suitable request that want to interact with a particular liquidity pool in order to fulfill the swap It is necessary to satisfy the spending do that with all other available swap and insert all the into one big batch transaction When a batch transaction know what have already been used They can ensure that a particular is not used twice within a batch transaction Such a transaction would fail respectively it would be by the network as a single can be spent only once Once the batch are confirmed by the network have their A big advantage is intuitive user experience as are not with each other when swap meaning no concurrency issue and swifter experience During the first phase the under which the swap can be are also defined The user can never lose the funds locked in the contract The swap either place or it does not take place and the user his funds back The model Let s explore the model in more detail Firstly need to create swap that must be settled and confirmed It can take approximately Secondly can take into consideration and collect new swap as soon as they appear in the ledger create large batch and effectively carry out many at once liquidity Notice that the off chain part of the functionality is any code utilize off chain code when they create swap utilize off chain code when they create batch These batch are large because of the included and a large number of and The agent s goal is to maximize efficiency and include as many swap as possible The more the agent can fulfill in a single transaction the less load on the lower overall and faster user experience Batch must be also and The confirmation can take another The total time after a request to the point where arrive into your wallet could be but in reality most of it is waiting for Anything over this could mean that the network might be congested or that are to reduce congestion It is still a challenge to design the model well If a a high number of against a single liquidity pool the need to be between This is likely to cause congestion when with a single liquidity pool and swap wait times will be very long This is what we could actually see in recent related that were on Twitter Let s see what can be and The transaction size can be reduced This t entirely solve the issue but it more into a block Similarly smart contract resource usage can be reduced as well The more optimal implementation for the smart contract the more smart contract can be inserted into the block Working on is a goal of every development team and a is not an exception As volume can go up fast well implementation is crucial Luckily the team very experienced Focus on the is the priority for the team from the inception to main net more and liquidity is usually a function of total A popular more It that the is more attractive for liquidity a large number of more liquidity with the same pair Thus swap can be better distributed to more is difficult is built from the ground up to provide the opportunity for any user to become an agent It s a complicated engineering problem but the team it pretty well and we already run a proof of concept in a browser The speed of Swap speed is a very important factor for One of the of will be the speed of Notice that the speed is dependent on many both internal and external To get a handle on this let s break it down and put it back together Every in a distributed network setting and its own and The t exist in a vacuum and there could be many other running in parallel To be able to provide with a smooth experience also use infrastructure that the state or even operate some business logic or The infrastructure also These are all external A block time is a property of the and it is the external factor Currently set the value at Swap speed is partly impacted by the block time but there are many that may have an impact on the overall network throughput the number of user If do not fit in the block they must wait longer for inclusion Some of the are currently set conservatively Other important the speed are block size the maximum transaction size limit script memory per transaction The team already a willingness to increase the Each parameter change is carefully considered and then by the team Further are based on the of the The team to meet the of and as far as possible At the time of writing the article a block can contain around size or about tiny In reality there is a mix of both in It is roughly per minute If all in a block would be script that would narrow the range down to around per minute for generic Realistically for with it would be around per minute In a typical block there may be a few large plus a number of smaller With higher network utilization the maximum space in the block is ideally If there were always a lot of large script in a block and the small were not getting through this could lead to more Take into account that these are slightly pessimistic as smart on are still in the early stage Many have been already can be done on the side of development and the team constantly the design The number of swap on the transaction size memory and usage of the smart This is where the internal of the design concurrency solution and become evident The team made a test on the public test net In swap If the were every the result would correspond to around per minute All this with other being present during testing To put it into perspective according to recent transaction v is closer to per minute of swap submit their swap in a given order are able to find these in the ledger and fulfill them that the order of will be by The is enforced to ensure fairness in the first come first principle are to fairly find the swap for a given liquidity pool Once swap are selected respecting the transaction size limit and script execution the batch transaction is Notice that even within these batch is crucial Imagine the following very simple batch transaction that only swap to which huge slippage to When his after s swap was he will get much more due to the slippage by However when s swap is before s swap he would get much less but it t hugely impact Notice how the order is important in regard to satisfaction and fairness Do you remember that there is nothing like a global state on the network and the order of does not matter So it is also true for the of smart have to take it into account during designing the logic of A transaction builder off chain part in the agent s code the order in which the need to be But even if the agent the correct order the situation is not so simple By design similarly to in a block the order of in a transaction no particular meaning To follow s design and ensure the fairness there must be a mechanism in place to manage the correct order of To ensure that indices inserted into are employed a particular input first in a transaction is not enough and the are sorted into a different before the transaction can be read by the That that without the additional indices in the can t know which input which request to carry out first and which to carry out second So the transaction builder s input first into the transaction and the redeemer to index It that it should be carried out first Analogically s Redeemer would be set to index The indices help the to find out which transaction input swap request to carry out first and which to carry out second Without the additional logic with the t be able to ensure that the swap are really in the correct order To explain this in other it is necessary to create extra logic to maintain the desired order as cannot provide this on the level of and their There is a reason why to ensure that all are in the order they were by the Besides fairness it is also necessary to verify that all have been correctly If not the validation would fail The team t want to compromise on the precision of the inside the smart just because the cannot rely on the input order We have designed a method that to ensure even inside the The network effect is the key to success Every service needs This is especially important for because the higher the number of and the higher the liquidity the better the service becomes is an exchange so it needs two of who want to exchange Next liquidity who want to use their or in order to earn have to pay for the and part of the collected are used for rewarding the liquidity The economic model is functional because the of two of are met The user interface and accessibility of the service are crucial This is where a big advantage thanks to its extensive experience with the project and its infrastructure The team s goal is to make a core infrastructure element This will be through the possibility of very easy integration into any wallet or The team how to do this very well as they have the popular wallet in the past and are now working on a new wallet a platform with to support The team also worked on with the and Ledger will be a very modular and flexible piece of suitable for integration This is an effective strategy to get closer to and expand the network effect How to satisfy Each team must carefully consider the design of the to offer attractive to and guarantee specific functionality The security of the service is an absolutely key feature for gaining user trust will let external namely examine the source code to ensure that and sent to the exchange address are never lost and liquidity can be sure that they will not lose their funds The emphasis on high security is in line with the project philosophy and a security audit is almost a necessary requirement for success that will be executed in canonical order There s no reason to give to anyone All will be equally The team is working to make as accessible as possible to all are an important part of the decision making Through the team is able to reduce the size of the for the network This will reduce the for the end user of Ease and clarity are other important for success The user interface is one of the for the team As already it will be very easy to integrate with and This can be already seen on their test net version where a deep integration into a wallet is shown In addition to the possibility of being for providing liquidity to the the team to retain the ability to participate in the of and thus not miss out on The ecosystem is rapidly and the first version of the exchange may not be completely optimal The team will reflect the evolution of the infrastructure and will adjust the accordingly Conclusion The aim of the article was not to compare and architecture Both are fundamentally different from each other and will find their own With the team we to show you how complex and it is to build on the network Almost nothing but the basic concept can be taken from the world and have to come up with completely new a strong

secure and efficient way A platform that would cover its be profitable but not a cash cow I have had this on my mind for some time and I can t seem to find one that my needs The thought is coming after seeing advertising their on twitter and telegram essentially doing the advertising themselves and to the exchange to their asset page And who are these on the same social directly from the I am aware of and store and their service range between and which I find is too high Assuming you re selling your and you already have a buyer or interested party what are your to your margin or reduce the middleman These have marketing IT insurance and other business and they provide a service beyond just the exchange of to a way for to find and to advertise their They are not and provide a discovery referral service that s fair enough But as a quick example a Cat got sold for K the platform received close to for the service I m just the question it is a fair fee to pay to the platform In a previous life I was a goods seller on a famous retail platform and I can t tell you how many I thought their referral fee was way too much essentially out a good chunk of the margin And I had to advertise on top of the platform itself When I think about I dream about how do we use the technology to reduce the middleman fee and yet keep going and I believe there might be some progress that can be made here Maybe what I m looking for already sorry if I t find it and if not perhaps it s worth a catalyst proposal to get something like this community funded that would ultimately benefit all as

always be easier and less risky for people to buy than and paying for energy is a mechanism that the power back in the of the people and is consistent with the of decentralization coin are the of expand the of without the need to trust third Greed the team to create a suitable economic model to ensure the security and decentralization of the network The more greedy people get the more the network will become Based on decentralization and through innovation we can build trustless Decentralization is not just about network consensus but about the possibility of building a universal and free infrastructure is not just about greed in the sense of wanting a reward but also about decentralization and thus the balance of the system Decentralization trust and greed The success of all will be primarily based on greed Greed been a major driving force for the growth in the value of People s desire to own for any reason is an important component of adoption Greed the team to design a suitable economic and security model of the network It is wise to base decentralization and security on adoption or more precisely on the distribution of since greed is a significant facilitator These key will grow together with adoption Note that in PoW greed only security as the market value of can increase but coin distribution no role in decentralization Decentralization is a powerful concept that a lot to offer to society and is not necessarily directly related to greed The right to greater privacy access to financial financial and social identity transparency fair treatment low the immutability of the of the game have nothing to do with greed They are legitimate valid anywhere in the world and there is no relation to speculation to the growing value of People have these when with each other when with or Unfortunately these are not enforceable verifiable or achievable People can very easily abuse their position of power The industry is about the ability to secure and improve these key In fact to achieve this we need to expand the of decentralization PP communication needs to be to rely more on technology and less on people Decentralization a very fundamental feature of society and that is trust People are losing trust in and the management of big IT It is the abuse of power and the inability to enforce the that lead to the loss of trust People are naturally looking for to and because we live in a digital age we are looking for at the level of network Decentralization can be seen as the ability to define new that no one is able to change and that the will automatically and completely fairly supervise People as of the will not let change the Transparency and the ability to audit the ledger are also important Even if someone gains a majority in the system and to change the or abuse their powerful position everything will be immediately exposed If someone to violate trust they would have to spend a huge fortune to buy large of in order to control the majority of a network However people s greed and desire for passive income from give an attacker little chance Moreover the question is whether the desire to control the network is when fraud can be quickly via on chain analysis Notice that is not just about greed in the sense of wanting a reward but also about decentralization and thus the balance of the system In every ecosystem there will be and power hungry The more economically or socially important a network is the greater the desire to control it The existence of and the possibility of people switching to another network will be part of the protection against the abuse of power of a network must be able to verify that they are in control of it in order to trust it On chain data will be used for this purpose If decentralization is technological progress will bring new for utilization These can provide the above and important for people For example the right to financial identity and the availability of financial is a global network and is available in all provided the is available can be greedy and desire to stake large of People in crave the use of financial infrastructure that local cannot abuse or prevent them from can be seen to some extent as a humanitarian gesture towards Of course people in can also stake if they can economically afford it but the primary concern is the existence of financial infrastructure What is important to for example is transparency in corporate or alternative financial with lower or fairer It may seem a little strange that we need to be greedy to improve but it can be seen as an act of taking power back into our own The more people get greedy the more will become A network is about the dispersal of power and the economic difficulty of gaining control That s why we need to build from the bottom up and allow every individual on the planet to own at least a small share is not just about network consensus and block production More broadly it s about building an infrastructure that can be much more universal All you have to do is buy a few and you can get that share of the decision making Once is sufficiently and adopted it is only a matter of time before it a greater financial and social impact In general any network must have a strong base in people i e the community as this is the only way to disrupt the current power Conclusion It is appropriate to see in all its colors and Behind rewarding through is the well thought out design of the protocol It s natural that most people greedily desire but it s good to know that this is related to decentralization and the ability of to own key infrastructure If we want to change our society and use more for our well being and greater freedom we need a suitable platform

item in Fiat usually They then need to find an exchange sign up to said exchange work out the amount of they need to buy to equate to the amount of the seller to receive then add to that amount the amount of to top up and the transaction The chance of getting this figure spot on is pretty minimal and usually up in either the buyer have an extra amount left in their account which t cost effective to withdraw or it up with them not sending enough to the seller meaning they have to go through the whole process again to send a much smaller amount therefore to pay twice and then are after this second time the buyer will then have the first issue of a small amount of stuck in the exchange My idea is to be a middle man so a buyer can message me tell me the amount of FIAT their seller to receive along with the recipient wallet address and I can then give them a price to send me to make sure the seller the correct amount This would take the stress out of topping up up to working out

because even when it s not high effort it s at least knowledgeable of s inner talking almost never bother with pro FUD because it too much work don t just reward a block subsidy they include

cream Since can set their own cream when a they can get priority if they pay a little more The highest fee I ever seen personally was but this was for a half billion in meaning the fee was one tenth of percent By the same token I also seen worth of millions on the move with under The point is the system is designed to to include Russia could be in some telling and quite given priority designation to if they spend a little more cream Talk about the cat getting the cream if you like Then there s the issue of mining Firstly these are not fixed Look at the history of mining and you see most of the big of yesterday have either fallen from the or don t even exist anybody Mining its very own free market and economy of scale It s just another reason of many why Proof of Work is so superior to Proof of Stake because a miner to continuously expend money and for and At times all will be unprofitable too for infinite natural difficulty adjustment energy price global equipment supply energy geopolitical green energy tech The free market is why blocking s would never work Mining can up an leave to a place that won t try And if they did comply and tried the of that make up their can in under switch their to a pool that t and with the snap of a finger the censorious pool will be out of the top ten forever Or they form new Either way the network will decentralize further This of course all that the origination of the transaction s is known to begin with which they t be not if they t originate from a exchange t lever the and t employed Even then exist plenty of ways around this In the very best DoS scenario they d be able to block some of Russia s s some large say for an hour or two before a miner or pool elsewhere picked it up maybe even their very own are by whomever s hash power the nonce first a large amount of t guarantee anything can literally go days without finding the nonce and getting a block It only that over a long time period you should get in proportion to your Then there s While a can sit in the for before getting auto will know who all the previous We know quickly who s decided to do this beauty of a transparent ledger and chain and don t think for a second that we haven t already proven ourselves with segwitx when the majority of the mining the exchange and s up to try and break consensus and force block sizes That was shut down

contract between and other of social power or they can repudiate this contract this year the decision to add to the balance of as an endorsement of value And so on cue people bought more Now is the other way and decided not to accept as a form of payment for its The good news is that while stumble more than eventually we all learn to walk the new money The difference between and fiat is simple

the Of course if can no longer be there is no use for outside of gaming and the mining of alternative such as Flux and While you can continue mining these the long term profitability is highly questionable and is likely to plummet with the demise of mining as we know it But we get to that in a minute The purpose of a transition to is to make scalable more secure and more sustainable No mining friendly What this possible is something shard Shard or is a scaling mechanism en shard that is to go live in Instead of dealing with the entire at the same time you deal in think of glass The purpose of shard is to build a more resilient and more scalable network A Better Picture It s important to understand that a transition to from PoW is just that a transition to the PoW model first before being entirely as in the graphic below These include energy efficiency as you no longer need energy to mine hardware for new and support for the shard the key player in scaling the network A transition to proof of stake is also to result in more in the network which significantly resistance to centralization The Merge and The Aftermath It s June and to proof of stake What to all of the who were to mine Well since mining are purpose built meaning they re better for mining one specific coin the went back into the of while dove head first into the market A significant rise in demand for mining equipment once officially to is not hard to imagine and that demand is likely to outpace the available supply a supply which already been affected by global supply chain due to Covid The last have been very profitable for in particular Many of them their mining with their personal gaming and have since significantly expanded their mining by building mining and This was their first foray into full time mining so what now Well there s a slim chance they be willing to give that up and it s very likely they keep mining simply because they know mining works It was these that people see the profit potential and further turned those who were just exploring their curiosity into In light of The Merge it won t come as a surprise when these sell their used rejoice and start to mining If you re following our line of logic an increase in demand and a decrease in supply will cause to jump making it increasingly difficult to obtain a miner All Lead to A new wave of is on the way The influx of on the secondhand market once the merge will have rejoicing but they be practically useless for mining With attention turning to and Q just around the corner it t hurt to start thinking about an today to avoid in the future and are not only the top based on market cap they re also the top s market cap is half of s based on this alone considering that market cap with the number of per
