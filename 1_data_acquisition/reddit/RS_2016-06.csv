6,ethereum,"Started reading the ""Blockchain Revolution"" book and there's already a lot on Ethereum &amp; Augur","First I wanted to state that this is not an endorsement nor recommendation for the book, I'm only on the fourth chapter so I don't even have an opinion yet.

Just finished the first three chapters and the discussion of Ethereum starts in chapter 2 with proof of work/proof of stake mentions. The Ethereum mentions in chapter 3 are in a section on ""Blockchain IPOs"", in which Ethereum &amp; Augur's crowdsales are mentioned. This leads to a pretty detailed summary of Augur as an example of something built on Ethereum.

When peeking ahead, I noticed chapter 4 seems to be mostly about ConsenSys and Ethereum, so more Ethereum discussion is to come in the book.

After reading about Augur, I got excited and made it a point to post about it on our subreddit. I realized some over here may be interested in this, so I felt I should share. 

Seeing a decent-length discussion on Augur in a published book that is selling fairly well on Amazon really blew me away and I can't explain the feeling. The fact that it appears Ethereum will be heavily covered in this book is fantastic too.... Being able to give this to my mom and family members where they can read about both Augur &amp; Ethereum is something I just cannot wait to do!",1464753826

15,ethereum,Encrypted Private Keys For Cold Storage?,"Hi,

I'm looking at getting one of those metal cold storage cards with the public and private keys engraved on to store with my PMs, this is easy enough to do for BTC and LTC using BIP38 encrypted private keys, therefore preventing the manufacturers stealing my coins!

I've looked at the paper wallet generators for Ethereum and so far the only working options I have found involve storing a JSON file (too big for these metal cards) or storing the unencrypted private key (way too insecure for giving out to a manufacturer).

On one of the sites, they offer encryption with a password, and I generated this testing key (with a password). 

U2FsdGVkX19lPJ8SdvlcgqJEdlj1ri+L1oF50xDjjDdWkCvoSyd7E7yzKn6+BEwMLoJTu+sp21rVUuG2z/wXAIDsIsSgQkkKFfjsOFz+d57qhy/0Uyu+t2xfUgBu6TQtfff4

I've been trying to find a way to import this wallet without relying on the same site to decrypt it again for me (since they may not exist when I plan on redeeming the account). So far I have had no success.

How should I go about getting a PK that is password encrypted for getting engraved? And how do I then Import it later on?

Thanks!

Edit: I did the generation on this site, they have a facility to decrypt the keys, but who knows if they'll still exist in 5 years.

33,ethereum,"If you took ETH Market Cap and divided it by # of BTC, you'd get a price of $70","Number of Bitcoins = 15,605,700
Market Cap of Eth = $1,110,572,281
$13.78 =ETH
$540 = BTC
.02551 = ETH/BTC

Theoretical Price of ETH if same number in circulation as BTC = $70.39

Ethereum would need to reach a price of $104.85 to reach a market cap equal in the size to BTC today. 

However, the supply of ethereum will probably outpace bitcoin so to reach equivalent market cap, price for eth would probably be lower still.  

I feel like eventually ethereum could reach parity with BTC on a market cap level. But probably never overtake in price. Given the fluid nature of crypto currencies, that BTC and ETH could have a rivalry on the scale of Coca-Cola Vs Pepsi.  One easily exchangeable for the other. Each stealing the other's ideas.  

I think it's wise to hold both.  And that's what I'm doing personally.  

My question to you is. **Which do you think will be the most volatile in price?** It seems to be ETH in my opinion. But perhaps that's because it's in it's infancy.

I do writing and design work for many international clients. I almost always have to chase down payments from clients in the Middle East and Africa. Could a smart contract solve this problem? 

I imagine it'd function like escrow. But in that case, the contract would still need an intermediary to resolve the dispute. I'm still newbish on Smart Contract capabilities, but surely they offer a solution here? 

I imagine there are many others who share my problems. A Smart Contract that somehow manages this problem would fulfill a HUGE need, in my opinion.

100,ethereum,Sidechain based smart contract issues,"Hi,

Maybe I'm wrong but I feel a common misunderstanding of the benifits of the single chain vs sidechains approaches. I see a lot of people
writing about of the advantages of sidechain approach (rootstock, lisk). Take a look for example here [quora topic of Lisk vs Ethereum](https://www.quora.com/Is-Lisk-going-to-compete-with-Ethereum). It seems to me that a lot of (even smart) people think that sidechain approach are somehow superior to single chain ethereum approach since it is more scalable and even more secure. They even say that ethereum still doesn't have a lot of dapps because of singlechain high dapp execution price (as you will see bellow probably there will be 0 useful sidechain dapps). 

I think we need to educate not too technical audience that sidechain approach has far more serious problems:

1) Most important sidechain approach disadvantage is that they won't have synergy by definition. That is dapps (smart contracts) won't be able to interact with each other. Think about it. Many ethereum top projects need synergy and it won't be possible/make sense to do them in a sidechain based crypto. To be more specific: 

* stablecoins (MakerDAO) - it has tremendous finance applications, any insurances, financial derivatives, and I think even DAOs and IOT should use stablecoin as a currecncy/store of value. Dapps interactions (synergy) here are obvious: stable coin is going to be used by a lot of other dapps, and even stablecoin implementation itself requires interaction with other dapps (cryptoassets, onchain exchanges)

* Augur - Despite it is (probably) possible to implement Augur in a sidechain, it is very cool to have an ability of smartcontracts to interact with Augur. You can create insurance against some disaster using Augur and sell it on onchain exchange (etherex).

2) Security. Proponents of the sidechain approach say that a lot of sidechains is more secure because a failure of one of them doesn't imply failure of the others. The thing is if you have n dapps and your cryptocurrency has S totoal hashpower (or stake) in average single dapp security is proportional to S/n compared to S for singlechain ethereum case. Thus most of the dapps will be kind of unsecure compared to corresponding crypto currency. Also, I think after a switch ethereum to the PoS any failure is considered practically impossible.

I would like to hear some proponents of the sidechain approaches what they think about synergy, and especially name at least one real world application that doesn't need/benifit from synergy?

PS. 
It would be cool if someone leave a post in the quora topic that LISK and ethereum actually are hardly competitors, since LISK doesn't have synergy.

Any pointers or advice for the technical design and implementation? Bitcoin has the OP_RETURN opcode that can be used for publishing fingerprints, but how would this work with ethereum?

102,ethereum,"Unable to sync (7th attempt in 10 days) , bought DAO tokens through jaxx wallet, I want to vote what are my options?","Namaste,

I recently was introduced to crypto and bought dao tokens through jaxx wallet I was very excited to be a part of the new revolution, but frustration took over as I entered the dark world of syncing the Ethereum node. 

currently working with  geth win64 1.4.5 
commands = geth --fast --cache=4096 --jitvm
disabled - superfetch and prefetch
started sync 1 hr ago - stuck at  127198 block 

Pc stats - win 8 intel i7-4407k samsung ssd250gb gpu gtx 980ti ram 8gb broadband - 5mbps 
location - Mumbai ,India

Now only 10 days left for voting

I will be thankful for anyone who answers the following
 
1) Is there any other way to vote ?
2) What happens to my tokens bought through jaxx wallet if my wallet refuses to sync before the voting deadline?
3) Should I transfer the keys from jaxx wallet to mist without syncing ?

Ethereum has a potential to change the world, but any non technical person will run away if he experiences the horror of syncing the node, if a user friendly way is not updated soon Etherium will take years to catch up , maybe till then the evil bankers destroy the world through ww3 or deadly virus or maybe mother earth decides to terminate us through natural calamities...

Humanity urgently needs to adopt a system of money that frees us form the control of bankers and govt, that freedom can trigger genuine peace and harmony worldwide.

I believe Ether could be the answer

I humbly request vitalik buterin and his friends to publish a website or a download link which is authorized secure and fast to download the ever increasing blockchain data and pardon millions of us from this syncing node misery

sorry to sound a little frustrated but this syncing has drained all my DAO excitement.

maybe jaxx rocket dao is my only hope, it looks so awesome 

Time is of the essence 

Peace 

Namaste.

Thanks for your inadvertent Expanse bug-report:

https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4khnmj/remove_frontier_canaries_which_were_left_in_by/d3t2lhi

While the canary was removed from geth back in April as /u/karalabe already mentioned twice:

https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/2416/files

That removal still hasn't happened for Expanse's clone:

https://github.com/expanse-project/go-expanse/blob/master/core/canary.go

So if they were feeling evil then /u/vbuterin, /u/jeffehhh, /u/gavofyork and /u/CJentzsch could collude to stall Expanse mining.

Of course, that will never happen.   None of the fears raised in this thread will ever manifest, because they are irrational.   Triggering the canaries for the tiny number of clients where that is even still possible would just stall mining on those nodes (if they were mining), would be very, very obvious to the whole world, has a one-line workaround and would be the most self-harming thing you could possible imagine.

You can try it out at by pasting the interface (that can be found at the bottom of the file) into mist. The contract is deployed at: 0x7679b5eCbAD1f5deA9c0160C6856321Eb61BC973 on morden testnet. Call the function ""player_make_bet"" and send a small amount (1 finney). The result should be revealed in a few minutes (I set up a script to do that).


Randomness comes from the owner committing and revealing spin results. It was designed to be completely fair to the player (unlike what I've seen in other gambling games). The owner either reveals the correct spin result, or the player wins by default by calling the player_declare_taking_too_long function after some period of time.

156,ethereum,Request for Feedback: Relay Contract Pattern,"https://github.com/Shapeshift-Public/relay

Hello from Shapeshift.io! We are requesting feedback from the community regarding a Solidity contract pattern we are considering for use in a dapp.

With the Mist browser and Metamask still in alpha, user-friendly dapp usage (where the user retains control of their private keys) is not quite possible yet. We are excited for these end-user tools to be released as they are an important step towards mainstream dapps. We would like to suggest a pattern that can may be used as a stopgap measure in the mean time.

The pattern is a relay mechanism in which a user can trigger any function on a contract by sending an arbitrary payment (value: 0) to a given address. Thus, any user can interact with a smart contract simply from their wallet, without an ethereum node, and without imparting additional trust to any third party.

This can be accomplished by deploying a proxy contract which triggers a specific function on a host contract within its fallback function. This proxy contract can be deployed on an ad hoc basis, even on a per-user basis with appropriate permissions, although the demo code does not include any permissions for simplicity.

Please see the repo for a full explanation and source code: https://github.com/Shapeshift-Public/relay. We are seeking feedback from the broader Ethereum/Solidity community to vet the idea and expose any security or usability concerns that may be present. Thank you!",1464911477

Just a friendly reminder to all those who have displayed their interest in the [etheroll.com](http://etheroll.com) ICO and are looking to invest in our Ðapp and the future of provably fair dice gaming using the Ethereum protocol; the countdown to our ICO has officially begun and there is absolutely no stopping us now!

**There are only 10 days left until our token sale is open!**

We have received considerable interest from investors all over the world and as such we may not be able to run our ICO for the entire two weeks as has been pre-scheduled. Once we sell out, that’s all folks! So we recommend you get some ETH prepared and ready for our opening date on June 13th 10:00 UTC so you don't miss out.

[Pre-register your interest today.]( http://etheroll.com/token-sale-updates.html)

**Our ICO is a one-time only event and will never be repeated again.**

That’s right. This will be your one and only chance to participate in our ICO. After this event has closed, token holders will be the only people who are eligible for a 90% lions share in the profits this house bankroll generates – in perpetuity!

Let us take a look at some numbers shall we? 

Satoshi Dice is a similar dice game, built instead for the Bitcoin protocol. It reported revenue in 2012 at ฿1,787,470. Its first year earnings were reported at a healthy ฿33,310.
Source: http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2013/01/22/bitcoin-casinos-release-2012-earnings/#5da1b23950cb

Here are some numbers over the past 7-30 days for popular BTC sites: https://thebitcoinstrip.com/leaderboard.html

~~฿33,310 is equivalent to ~$20,000,000 in profits in 2012 alone. That is not a typo.~~

With just 10 days remaining until the launch of our 14 day token sale, we thought it best just to remind those that are interested, exactly we have on offer for our token holders;

Our application is very close to launch. The only purpose of this token sale is to raise ETH that is to be used as the house bankroll.

We have a live date scheduled for August 15th 2016! 

Each token grants its owner the following rights and has the following characteristics:

I feel that this undermines their legitimacy. How can a company that handles the finances of its customers not have a telephone number, or at the very least live chat support?

They do have an email ticket system, but it takes them days to respond. That is, I hope it takes them days, as I am still waiting. At the moment I cannot access my account, because it has potentially been compromised. Perhaps others have had similar experiences.

In situations like these, customers need immediate support, or at the very least a response within the day. I think it is unfortunate that Coinbase decided to skimp on it's customers like this.

If you are interested in trading ETH with Coinbase/GDAX, just be warned--their customer support is horrible.

I made a backup to my NAS of a file but i can't check if it's the right one until I get home in 2 days, in case it's not right is there any way to recover the key?

EDIT : I was using the official client from github
EDIT 2 : I redownloaded the blockchain and wallet and it magically appeared back, that's nice :)
Thanks all for your help greatly appreciated

Cheers guys",1465043131

235,ethereum,Ethereum Hacking Incident - Waiting for Your Help,"Fundraising Site:

http://security7218.org/

Due to the hacking on May 12th, 2016, Patrick (stardust) lost all 7218 ethers that he had mined since the launch of ethereum. Instead of falling to disappointment and giving up, he traced and extensively investigated the hacker's attack, found the attack vector, and discovered critical security vulnerabilities in the geth-mist wallet. He immediately reported this information, in detail, to ethereum community.

Following the exposure of the vulnerabilities, the geth-mist dev team applied two urgent security patches. The desire and need for a stronger security system is widely shared in the ethereum community. We welcome the dev team's security patches, and believe they will develop a stronger security system in the future.

However, instead of appreciating Patrick's efforts to document this security vulnerability to help prevent future incidents, despite his large personal loss, he was met with suspicion of his motivation and personal attacks. We hope that his reputation is restored and that he receives fair acknowledgement of his contribution to the security interests of ethereum users.

If you believe he contributed to the ethereum wallet's security, please show your support by participating in this fundraising campaign.

All fund collected will be sent to Patrick's wallet, but if more funds are collected than his loss, the excess ethers will be donated to the ethereum foundation's official bounty program.

Did you know the Ethereum Stack Exchange beta site is **the _most_ active beta site in the whole Stack Exchange network** which consists of more than 80 beta sites? Well, now you know.

Ethereum is hot and the Stack Exchange subsite seems to be very welcomed by our community.

Check out the **quadruple excellent stats** on the [beta progress dashboard](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/89704/ethereum).

It's very likely that there is a chance for the [site's graduation](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4dqr55/lets_graduate_the_ethereum_stack_exchange_before/). However, there are still a few things with some room for improvements.

1. There are [125 questions without upvoted or accepted answers](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/unanswered/tagged/?tab=votes). Feeling lucky today? Let's answer them!
2. The answer ratio of 1.4 answers per questions could be improved. There are [655 questions with only one answer](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/search?tab=votes&amp;q=answers%3a..1%20hasaccepted%3ano). I'll encourage users to also answer questions which already have answers!
3. And last, but not least, join [the meta site](http://meta.ethereum.stackexchange.com/) and discuss the progress, the scope and everything else about the Ethereum Stack Exchange Q&amp;A site.

314,ethereum,H E R M I C I T Y - Request For Community's Ideas On Direction,"Hi everyone,
Thanks again for all your support for [our project](http://hermicity.org)!

At the moment we're in the process of building a roadmap and will soon be expanding our team. We are pretty keen on our general direction, but we are interested in putting some ideas to the community first as a litmus test of sorts. So let's get to the point.

A) Should we prioritise getting a pilot Hermicity set up and running first? Get our hands dirty, sort out a land deal, crowd sell ownership of the first Hermicity, build micro dwellings, get Hermits moving in and paying rent to the owners?

B) Or should we prioritise setting up the technological infrastructure with the intention to set up the first Hermicity later? Focus on developing the proposal system, sophisticated crowd selling and rent payment systems (integration with slock.it for doors etc), the library of DAPP code for drone deliveries and other decentralised hermit lifestyle enabling code.

In our opinion, option A is exciting because we would get something tangible up really quickly, allow people to see and understand the vision clearer. But B is super important because the technological infrastructure will allow other people to build Hermicities all over the world.

Ideally we want to do both and we will do both, the question is just on focus. A is important because it allows us to deliver an MVP and fight through a lot of the early and unforeseen problems, setting precedents and forming a lot of documentation to help other people set up Hermicities in future. B is important because ultimately, it is the whole project. We don't want our team to set up every Hermicity, that is inefficient - if we give people the resources and technological infrastructure to go out and build decentralised, autonomous hermit cities, then they will do so over the world and we can grow out our project much quicker. Plus it will create a market of developments, with different market segments. A good analogy is Ethereum itself, Vito and his mates are not building the DAPPs and the DAOs, they are just providing the platform and core tools for everyone else to do that.

So, what are your thoughts? We have received hundreds of email submissions with comments and ideas, among with the media enquiries and people offering their skills. But it would be good to get a discussion here too to see more ideas on what people think our priorities should be. Thanks for your time :)",1465211681

I wonder what considerations led the Ethereum team to focus on the first approach.
The idea of a stake based system only seems to be applicable to a single realm of (global) consensus, that requires the peers to unconditionally trust a certain set of peers and always remain online - which may be more efficient.

The advantage of subjective algorithms seems to be that subsets of the network can still agree on some fact (""local consensus"") and only need to utilise global consensus when it is truly required (e.g. when double spends have to be avoided). This seems to be relevant to sharding somehow.

A way to think about global economic consensus is that you incentivise the consensus set/miners to approve a set of states of which some elements may be against their own interests. But once these peers have been established, they are free to police which transactions to include and ignore. This seems to put a price on neutrality, which is countered by possible conflicts of interest.

318,ethereum,Using mist on a standalone computer - how paranoid is too paranoid?,"Hello,
I really have a paranoid-ness issue about using my ether in Mist.
I want to use Mist, but I have nowhere to install it I can call ""safe place"".

So I am asking.. how paranoid is too paranoid, how much precautions should I take since I'm very afraid of viruses and keyloggers.
The most frightening thing for me is that I have 3-4 computers in my house, but they ALL installed viruses and they are basically ""porn computers"" in the past. They are not clean computers.
I also know virus can dig so much deep they can corrupt the bios which is flashable.
It got me so paranoid I am now planning to buy a DEDICATED laptop just to install Ubuntu and Mist on it.
Are my fears justified?

Another question : Where can I find a clean ubuntu install? since I have no clean computer to install it from?
If I burn an Ubuntu DVD, how can I verify that the burned data is exactly the one I downloaded - and was not modified in the process by the burning computer as it was burned to the DVD?
If anyone has knowledge about this subject and how cautious I should be with my money, I'd like some information.. Thanks.",1465214467

This marks the official debut of The DAO on iOS, and marks the first time users will be able to manage their DAO tokens on iOS devices.You can Send and Receive DAO tokens via this screen, and manage your tokens between existing Jaxx Ethereum accounts.

**Please note that in order to see your DAO token balance, you will need to have a pre-existing ETH transfer. Please also note that you will not be able to transfer from any DAO account that does not have an ETH balance as the transfer will require ETH. You will be prompted on the DAO wallet screen if you have DAO accounts with no ETH balance. Lastly, our multi-function camera button located on the main screen defaults to ETH view when you scan your DAO QR code. This is because we haven’t found a way to determine whether you’re scanning an Ethereum or DAO address. Best thing to do is use the normal send button and scan the QR code or paste in the address you are sending to. In our next update we’ll have a workaround wherein you are prompted as to which QR code type you’re scanning.**

You can get Jaxx 1.0.1 with the DAO wallet screen at the App Store [here](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1084514516&amp;mt=8).

Download all other versions from [jaxx.io](https://jaxx.io).

423,ethereum,What is the incentive for a dev to create an Ethereum killer app?,"Lately I've been trying to think of an application to code on the Ethereum blockchain.  
I had a couple of ideas of useful applications.  
  
However I find it's order to come up with a way of monetizing the application.  
After all, Ethereum is all about cutting the middle man, but isn't the middle man the enabler?  
  
Who will have the motivation to code the Uber killer if they don't get any revenue from it?  
  
So far the I have seen devs getting revenue using two methods:  
- Selling tokens for funds
- Slock.it creating their own client in the for of The DAO.  
  
If I write a useful application tomorrow, sell it, and take a commission on transactions, what's to prevent someone else to reuse the code, remove the commissions and give the app for free?  
  
Things are different for big companies or groups: They can use the blockchain to cut off internal middle men - i.e.: not requiring some tasks to be performed by humans anymore.  
  
Things are also different for The DAO: it has reach a critical mass, it has momentum, the code cannot just be copied.  
  
But what's in for the average Joe developer though?

What happens if somehow, something goes balls up and the digix ledger gets wiped (EMP, global catastrophe) all that gold you were banking on is now on the other side of the world, controlled by a foreign power that has no allegiance to you...

434,dogecoin,Dogecoin: The Most Stable Cryptocurrency?,"Many people don’t care about Dogecoin. What a joke, right? It was started as a joke, after all. The way the people communicate is such a joke – sorry, such joke, very silly.

These things might be true, but here’s something else that’s true: Dogecoin has consistently been in the top ten market capitalizations for cryptocurrencies, and since its initial highs in March last year, it’s been relatively stable in terms of both market capitalization and value.

Coinmarketcap.com
Coinmarketcap.com
The value we’re referring to could be very low, but with high inflation comes easier access to the coins. Many of its holders are holding millions of the altcoin, either still waiting for the day that it goes back to its former glory or using it in much the same way as Bitcoin.

cryptsy.com
cryptsy.com
One thing is for sure: the Dogecoin community has managed to pull together and achieve some remarkable feats. They’ve sponsored a few NASCAR races, a school in Cambodia, and even a mini lunar rover race. Compared to Bitcoin, they tend to agree on many things by default.

The spirit of Dogecoin took a hit earlier in the year when creator Jackson Palmer told another outlet that he was tired of white men being over-represented in cryptocurrency circles. In the same interview he essentially denigrated all that is holy in digital cash, by praising the feature of bank accounts and traditional financial instruments that allows one to reverse potentially fraudulent charges.

Regardless, Dogecoin continues its path, having a fraction of a cent in value per XDG. If stability is what people are looking for in cryptocurrency, perhaps it’s time to stop advising them to try Bitcoin, and try Dogecoin instead, because this stability is not created by a lack of trading in any sense – Dogecoin is still one of the top-traded coins on numerous altcoin exchanges.",1465372530

442,ethereum,Voting on DAO proposals (for beginners),"Hi all - I'm new to Ethereum.  Despite the extensive searching I've done, **I've been unable to find any layman's explanations, tutorials or guides for how voting on a DAO contract works**.  This post will hopefully answer some basic questions that I (and likely other n00bs to the community) have. 

BACKGROUND:

Say I have 50 Ether and 10 TheDao tokens at my Ethereum address.  I then want to vote on a TheDao proposal, for which I know the Proposal ID [5].  Using this link, I'm able to find an option which seems to allow me to vote on the selected proposal: https://www.myetherwallet.com/#dao-proposals

QUESTIONS: 

* Does voting actually cost Ether (with the exception of the marginal ""gas"" required to process the transaction)?  What does, ""Proposal Deposit:  2 Ether"" mean?
* I presume if I have 10 TheDao tokens, that means I can contribute 10 ""votes"" to the approximate 85 million already voted?
* When I vote and ""send"" tokens, do these tokens remain at my Ethereum address, or are they expended/exhausted for good until I buy more?
* If I use all my 10 TheDao tokens on a particular proposal, am I then excluded from voting on any other TheDao proposals until this proposal is finished?
* What does this mean: ""Note: If you vote on a proposal, the tokens cannot be sent until the proposal period ends."" 
* What does this mean: ""If you wish to vote with a portion of your tokens, you must send them to a new account first and then vote with only one account.""

I hope to get some answers on above from the community, and then come back with some further questions.

Thanks in advance for everyone's input!

Cheers

Thankfully there are instructions now, thanks to Ursium (https://blog.slock.it/dao-how-to-vote-video-tutorial-e9919a0fcc1f#.ishhbtulc)
2. People do not want to vote and lock up their DAO Tokens for extended periods of time, while voting is in progress.
3. People do not see any good proposals.
4. People do not care/do not know about voting, they are simply speculating.

473,dogecoin,Dogecoin value maximum in theory,"I did a quick calculation, and it turned out that Dogecoin's theocretical maximum value is 1$ per doge (in this economic position).



Bitcoin capitalization is 9 billion usd, dogecoin is 25m. the difference is approx 360x. so if dogecoin would have the same acceptance and popularity like bitcoin, the price would be 360x bigger (0.00025*360= ~0.1 usd). 



Bitcoins community is on the maximum, it cant grow any more (the price can of course grow, but not the whole comminuty, becouse they alreday exhausted the whole possible transaction number per block, so the capitalization will not significantly able to growth within this economic situation, just mostly folowing the usd/yuan inflation). 


But: dogecoin is capable to transfer ~10x more transaction within the same time, this means they can sustan a 10x bigger community, which results 10x bigger theocretical capitalization. 10*0.1 = 1 usd, so 1 dogecoin maximum price in theory is 1 usd.



If bitcoin starts dying within weeks (becouse the block reward halfing), dogecoin and other cryptos can overtake it. i dont believe litecoin and other popular altcoins could fulfill the remaining space, they basically dont have any community. but dogecoin do have, and having the chance to expand our community to a new level, if we now try to introduce dogecoin in wide range of people, we can be the number one borderless money system.



i alreday started to introduce it in a few community, for example, movie subtitle translators, to accept donations for they work in doge. not yet any serious success, but if people hear from it, the adoption would be easyer.

474,ethereum,Solidity in-memory SQL database,"Hello,


I am proposing to create an Ethereum library that would create an in-memory relational SQL database that would support basic SQL syntax, and store table data in the contract itself.

Rationale:

-  There is a lot of talk about using Ethereum to create a decentralized internet, including DNS and websites. Ethereum mist client can be used to act as a GUI browser for decentralized applications.

 However, most of the modern websites are built using databases. In fact, database engines are used for almost all the sites that have dynamic content.

- I think that it is possible to create an Ethereum-based database that contract developers could use in their contracts. No additional work by the Ethereum protocol developers is required. This can be implemented using existing technologies.

- I think that such a database engine would allow developers to quickly deploy anonymous and decentralized websites, such as forums, e-commerce websites, etc. In fact, they could port existing (PHP/Python/etc) site engines to Ethereum, if SQL will be used.

- Some things are already taken from the web, such as HTML for client interface rendering. Database is an important piece of the stack that is not yet adopted.

- There is an active discussion about creating upgradeable contracts. 
 Basically, the idea is to store data and contract code separately. Various hacks and workarounds are used, because Solidity is not exactly built for this kind of job.
 
 I think that having an in-code database will greatly simplify this task. Why? Because the benefit of the databases is that you can export them to a universal format, and then re-import it at any time. So, you could do:

 1) Regular backups. Database can be backed up with a single query
 
 2) Easy upgrade of the contract code without losing underlying data

 3) You could keep database running in a separate, independent contract. This allows many possibilities.

- Relational databases features such as transactions and ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) can be very helpful in the world of financial technology where exactness and reliability is required.  Tools like foreign keys can keep the integrity and connect various pieces of data together.

- Although relational database will create some processing overhead, database engines usually provide tools that greatly reduce computing, such as indexing, compression and cache. Nevertheless, I don't think this is a great concern if availability of such a database would allow developers to build applications that they otherwise wouldn't have built.

- Compared to using variables and arrays, relational databases allow an easier way to sort, group, and in general to organize the data in a more quicker and intuitive manner. That will make it easier for developers to build large scale apps.

Technical details:

- I recommend to look at any in-memory DB for inspiration. They exist in almost every programming language.
- Why use SQL? It is a universal language, it is tried and tested.

Concerns:

- What if something goes wrong in the database? Of course, this may happen. However, coding problems can create problems in a vanilla contracts as well. I do not recommend to rely on such a database for irreversible financial actions, however, I think it can be used right away for less risky things. Like DAO forum. In case something goes wrong, people will be always able to revert to a previous backup.

- Is it difficult to do? It may be considered difficult. However, there are more difficult things in programming. SQL language description is in the open, the database theory is publicly available, and the task is clear. This is a question of time and motivation. Real-world databases are usually very sophisticated and complicated, however in-memory database can be greatly simplified, because it doesn't require working with IO. There are a lot more features that can also be set aside until needed.

Please let me know what you think. I was considering starting such a project, however I am quite busy as is in my day job. So, for now I have decided to make my thoughts public and I am hoping that community would consider this.

If I go 100% in on DAO but keep it in cold storage (at least until we can see if the project will work or not), I still have the possibility of splitting it back into ETH at a 100:1 ratio, right? Does that option ""expire"" at any point? I know I can only split back the tokens I haven't used, but if they're offline, I won't be voting with them anyway.

Is this a viable strategy? I want to speculate on ETH, and the opportunity to split back at 100:1 at any point in the future is attractive (even if ETH increases substantially in value), particularly when DAO is trading at a 107:1 ratio right now. Is there something more about this strategy I should be aware of?

532,ethereum,"New to Blockchain and Etherum, where to start (As a dev)?","**TL;DR (But I suggest you to read everything):**

* Is my ''dream'' to become a Dapp developer legit ?

* Is my plan (available below) good enough ? What should I change ?

* What are the good articles/tutorials/courses to execute my plan ?

* Finally, do you think Dapp development is the future of development ? (replacing traditional client-server-db architecture ?).

Hi everyone,

I was browsing the internet and then I was reading about IPFS, IPDB, BigchainDB, that are all technologies and protocols based on P2P networks and the blockchain.

Then I got an illumination, I saw the ""future"" and got pretty excited.
I'm a developer, more specifically a web app developper (mainly backend) and when I saw all those possibilities about decentralized uber scalable apps and data, with all those subtle and complex but very reliable independent mechanisms behind, I told myself: 

This is the future, this is the future of internet, this is the future of the world, all my current knowledge that I think is bleeding edge isn't at all. The future is maybe not client-server-db architecture, not http and all the protocols I know, not all what I'm thinking. Now I realise that when I think of the internet as it is now, most of our data, tools and liberty is owned by big corporations and are dependent on physical managed infrastructures.

Now my dream is to become a ''full stack'' Distributed app developer, but there is too much thing to read and I don't know where to start and what to read.

**Here's my plan (please contribute to it):**

* 1) Learn about the blockchain and how it works (because I think it is the very basics of all this new world, Am I right ?)

* 2) Learn how technologies based on the blockchain can achieve the followings: computing (to replace the server part), data storage (to replace the DB part) and all the glue between them.

* 3) Know the limitations of such technologies (things that are doable with ''old'' architecture but not with distributed one).

* 4) Pick some tools, languages, frameworks that can achieve what I described in 2) and learn them.

* 5) Build some small Dapps.

Is this plan legit ? What should I add or remove ?

Also, one quick open question: Do you think Distributed app development is the future of development ?

I hope this will attract some people and start a great conversation that will help a lot of people like me to embrace this new era of technologies.

I can walk into an ATT store and get it done. Wait time:  30 minutes.  Plus another 30 minutes to shuffle through the BS.

I can do it on the ATT website (business Premier) and do it and it takes something like 10 minutes to clickthrough....then I waited.....waited....waited.....waited....Finally started a chat with (insert random agent here) and was told ""thanks for you info! Your all set.  You did everything correctly and your account is currently under review. Activation of new number will take place in the next 24-48 hours"".

Ok....so let's break it down.

I have a Sim# that came with said IMEA# phone.  I have money.  All 3 of these component sound like a smart contract to me.

Can ethereum's protocol be enough for a company like ATT to embrace activations in a blockchain scenario?  There is a billing cycle as we all know is tied to a card/bank about but specifically could just the purchase/activation side be handled more quickly under some sort of transaction on the blockchain?

Something tells me smart money should be looking into this sort of humdrum activity.  

I can't fake an IMEI, a token, or a SIM number to my knowledge.  Someone here is going to be able to tell me the what/why. 

I have a 13 year old daughter with straight A's who deserves this phone to get activated in the next block.  My brother and I are all for Ethereum. He thinks we're talking 10 years from now to do blockchain activation. I told him 15...just because  FUck ATT.

Perhaps another 20,000 had dabbled with some of that technology, or written front-end applications that connect to a blockchain, one way or the other.

552,ethereum,Smart Contracts - a question (or two),"I think I understand how the blockchain works (in theory).  The blockchain is more or less a ledger that is stored on every node in the network and any transactions must be verified against other members of the network to ensure that (1) the sending party has the funds or whatever that they are trying to send and (2) that they're not trying to send the same thing twice.

So if this understanding is correct, how does this work with smart contracts?  Smart contracts, as I understand them, are programs and rules that you can put on the ledger so that they can not be interfered with as they go through the same verification process as transactions.  Does this mean that every program that is put on the network will be on every machine on that network?  Won't that take up a lot of storage space and slow things down?  Is this what people talk about when they refer to scaling issues?",1465506664

The repository with the code is here https://github.com/RexetBlell/EthereumRoulette, feel free to use the code and learn from it. 

The cool thing is that you don't need anything except Mist to play. The instructions how to add to Mist and play are here: https://github.com/RexetBlell/EthereumRoulette/blob/master/README.md
The first thing you can try once you add it to your Mist, is explore the Spins box, where you can see the results for previous spins.

The contract has about 70 Ether in it. Let's see if someone can figure out how to hack it and steal it :). The max bet size is 1/800th of the balance of the account, so around 0.05 Ether currently (which I will increase over time if no hacks are discovered). The roulette pays 35 to 1, so same as in Las Vegas.

The game is provably fair. The owner commits spin results by committing a sha3(spin_result, nonce). Once bets are placed, the owner reveals the result. If after a certain period of time, the owner did not reveal the result, all players who placed a bet win by calling the player_collect_winnings function.

If you notice a flaw where either a player or the owner can cheat in some way, please send me a private message, I will send you a reward of up to 10 Ether.

EDIT 3: False alarm - I have no idea why these guys are obfuscating their git history and github names, but otherwise it does look like a legit port of EtherEx which does not use a distinct ERC20 wrapper for Ether. The bad eth wrapper address isn't in the dapple environments but does map to defined contracts - there's no dappfile so figuring out where those were coming from took a long time. Otherwise great job, it's actually a great dapp and hopefully this gets them some extra attention =P

~~EDIT 2:  I did find contract code and it has no apparent vulnerability - it appears to be a modification of EtherEx updated for the new token standard,   BUT THE MAIN POTENTIAL PROBLEM IS THE ETH TOKEN WRAPPER WHICH I CANT FIND IN THIS REPO~~

~~Does anyone have any info on it? Until someone steps forward to claim ownership I think it should be regarded with EXTREME caution:~~

Slackuser: (u/i3nikolai) nikolai [1:33 PM] (June 11, 2016)

@channel

tl;dr Go cancel maker-otc orders right now.

Today we discovered a vulnerability in the ETH token wrapper which would let anyone drain it. This was the contract used by maker-otc and was intended to be used for the all future dapps that manipulated Ether.

We successfully executed the attack ourselves after proving we could spend ETH from the admin multisig. Everyone's tokens (both ETH and MKR) are safe, as far as we know. What this means for us is that we have to use the chain state right before we executed the attack to refund everyone their ETH. This includes all orders in maker-otc and all other ETH wrapped in the wrapper.

The main issue right now is that any open MKR sell orders can be ""bought"" with unbacked ETH tokens. This is a minor annoyance, because we can send the ETH tokens to the seller as if the trade actually executed.

What this means is that how fast we can get everyone's ETH back depends on how much damage trolls do by buying MKR with ETH that the multisig holds now. Again, in any case, the ETH is safe, and there's no other known exploits.

There will be a full post-mortem before tomorrow night.

Sorry everyone - this problem snuck past 2 nexus devs and an external auditor. Hopefully our bright red warning text communicated this risk.

650,ethereum,Issue with Importing Oraclize-Solidity API,"I am trying to create some contracts that will utilize the Oraclize API, and something curious has arisen. 

In order to use the oraclizeAPI.sol file (https://github.com/oraclize/ethereum-api/blob/master/oraclizeAPI.sol), I cloned this file and saved it to the following directory on my local: 

%USERPROFILE%/AppData/Local/GitHub/oraclize/ethereum-api/

(...from which, you can probably tell, is a Windows machine.)

Now, in the online Solidity Realtime Compiler, I created my Solidity contract, and on the first line I import the Oraclize API as follows: 

import ""github.com/oraclize/ethereum-api/oraclizeAPI.sol"";

...and it works just fine! It appears to be ready to go. 

However, then I copy this code, go to my Ethereum Wallet (on the Test Net, using version 0.7.4 Beta 18), ""Deploy new contract"", and paste in the code....I get the following error: 

Could not compile source code. Error: :1:1: Error: Source not found: File not supplied initially.

651,ethereum,Idea: Creator utility to create contracts using .call(),"I've asked on [ethereum.stackexchange.com](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/5676/create-new-contract-via-call), and seems it's not possible to create new contracts using `.call()`, so the proposal system on DAOs like [ethereum.org/dao](http://ethereum.org/dao) and [github.com/slockit/DAO/blob/master/DAO.sol](https://github.com/slockit/DAO/blob/master/DAO.sol) cannot deploy new contracts. Is this right ?

I wrote this [Creator utility](https://gist.github.com/resilience-me/9a61c8981b8a445b4709d15d14c21036) that DAOs could use to deploy new contracts. They call it using `.call(bytecode)`, it creates a contract, and returns the address of the new contract.

    /* 
     * inline assembly used to create new contracts using the create(s, p, v) opcode
     *
     * create(v, p, s)	 	create new contract with code mem[p..(p+s)) and send v wei and return the new address
     * From http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/control-structures.html?highlight=create 
    */

    contract Creator {

            function newContract(bytes p, bytes s) public returns (address) {

                address theNewContract;
                uint v = msg.value;
            
                assembly {
                    theNewContract := create(v,p,s)
                }
            
                return theNewContract;
            }

    }

DAO proposals set this utility as beneficiary, include the `bytecode` for invoking `newContract(p, s)` with `p` and `s` that codes for a new contract, `msg.value` is sent to the new contract, and the **Creator utility** returns the address of the new contract.

Haven't tested it since I don't know how `p` and `s` are used, but I think the contract should work. Could someone ELI5 `p` and `s`, and give an example of how to create a contract using `create(v,p,s)` ?

**TL;DR: Wondering if the standard DAO proposal system can deploy new contracts. Had the idea it cannot. Created a way for it to do so.**

UPDATE:
u/i3nikolai's gave a great ELI5 of `create(s, p, v)`, and taught me about [CALLDATACOPY](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/control-structures.html?highlight=calldatacopy), added it to the contract. Unsure how to find the position of where in the callcode `data` begins, asked on [ethereum.stackexchange.com](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/5925/can-a-contract-know-at-what-position-in-a-callcode-an-argument-begins)


    /*

    contract Creator {
    
            function newContract(bytes data) public returns (address) {
    
                address theNewContract;
                uint v = msg.value;
    
                uint s = data.length;

                assembly {
                    calldatacopy(0x40, f, s )
                    theNewContract := create(v,0x40,s)
                }
    
                return theNewContract;
            }
    
    }    


UPDATE: Huge thanks to /u/peterborah for putting the final touches to the Creator-utility, and for answering the question on [Can a contract know at what position in a callcode an argument begins?](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/5925/can-a-contract-know-at-what-position-in-a-callcode-an-argument-begins/5948#5948)

The Creator-utility uses the [""free memory pointer""](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/control-structures.html?highlight=free%20memory%20pointer#conventions-in-solidity) `0x40`, and `mload(0x40)` to fetch a free memory address from it, then copies `data` there, and then uses `create(v, p, s)` to create a new contract from `data`, and returns the address of the new contract.

I've [deployed a Creator-utility](http://testnet.etherscan.io/address/0x13c70b6a9cf21ec46e611401d0238c8b6f907a88#internaltx) on the testnet, and used it to deploy [a new Creator-utility](http://testnet.etherscan.io/address/0x4c60d82984f7131dc77ad1b92edee79ca970cf75#internaltx), and used the child-utility to create [a new one](http://testnet.etherscan.io/address/0xda03fa8fc5f387297f837e0ac9254b1aa455dd56#internaltx), and used the grand-child Creator [to create a new one](http://testnet.etherscan.io/address/0xed513277854315b3d128fca1dea7788181ce1d34#internaltx). So it works :)


Also deployed a Creator on 0x02268047f5c77a6a533619773474d1a6e510443f on the mainnet ([verify code](http://etherscan.io/address/0x02268047f5c77a6a533619773474d1a6e510443f#code))

        function newContract(bytes data) public returns (address) {
            address theNewContract;
            uint s = data.length;

            assembly {
                calldatacopy(mload(0x40), 68, s)
                theNewContract := create(callvalue, mload(0x40), s)
            }

            return theNewContract;
        }

There's a similar spike on the Chinese exchanges, and in both cases you can trade fiat pairs. Which is good, because BTC rates are holding steady at 40 sat.

If you're going to trade effectively, you have to hedge your bets *(and of course trade small parcels)*. And trading in multiple currencies is the way to do that. Because while one rate may go up, another may well move in the opposite direction. As long as you have liquidity in the range of currencies, you're well placed to take advantage no matter which way the markets move.

Remember that for our beloved Doge to stay relevant, it needs support. That means more people **USING** it, not just stashing it under the mattress. Spend it, tip it, give it away, sure. But we also have to trade it. The higher our volumes, the more stable the exchanges are, and the more non-shibes will take notice.

667,ethereum,Idea: Distributed Football League,"It would be very interesting to replace the NFL with a DAO. Perhaps the DFL: Distributed Football League. 

The DFL is a DAO and each team is also a DAO. Each team/DAO has independent investors, managers, coaches and players, scouting from wherever they see fit, and paying whatever they see fit. 

The DFL DAO's members are all the team DAOs, with maybe a voting mechanism to add new team DAOs into the league. All team DAOs will vote on things like rule changes, stadium rentals, game streams/revenue, drafts, etc. All the same stuff the NFL might do.

This would also be a very interesting way to combine fantasy football with real football, which I'm sure most fantasy football nerds would love to participate in.

There are so many brilliant minds behind the likes of bitcoin and ethereum in particular. But it seems that these beautiful minds have missed a crucial factor that might be the last mountain to climb before these currencies can really explode. I keep reading articles that are blaming the low DAO voter turnout on lack of ""worthy proposals."" 

I'll go ahead and argue that the low turnout has nothing to do with the actual proposals themselves, but instead in the ways in which they can be discovered, examined, and then voted for. 

The fact that over $150M was invested in the DAO and there aren't any easier ways to view and vote on proposals is absolutely mind boggling to me.

I realize that there are a few entities out there working hard on providing some solutions to this problem, but it really needs to be considered more seriously by the community as a whole. (That includes and is direct mostly at programmers who think UI/UX designers aren't really necessary.) I love many of the ideas floating around in the crypto world and I think that this problem will be solved, hopefully sooner than later.

I believe that until my 63 year old father can feel comfortable buying/selling/voting with dao, ethereum, bitcoin, or whatever the next big thing might be, we will not see the full potential of cryptocurrency.

So let's say I have a commercial idea, which would leverage Ethereum technology in the form of a smart contract, in the sense that I can transact with users who send Ether to a specified address. 

*Here are my questions for you:*   

**Question 1:**  can I establish a smart contract which performs actions based on the fact that Ether has been sent to an address?

**Question 2:** say the answer to above is ""yes"";  does the ""source-code"" of that smart contract (and what it does) necessarily need to be publicly available?

745,ethereum,"Hello world! A friendly reminder, the etheroll crowdsale is now live.","Hi there, we thought you should know that our crowdsale is now live!

**How do I participate in the crowdsale?**

Please visit our website at  [etheroll.com](http://etheroll.com/token-sale.html) for instructions.

We will be adding support and instructions for popular wallets in the next 24-48hrs. In the meantime, we currently have detailed instructions on how to participate using the Ethereum wallet on our website.

**A quick reminder on the details of our crowdsale**

Fuel the token sale with ETH during our token creation phase, and you become the holder of HERO (ɧ) tokens that grant you rights to a percentage of the profits the total bankroll generates, as well as the right to vote on proposals (new games/features).

During the token sale, when etheroll receives ETH, HERO (ɧ) coins are sent directly to the sender.

Each token grants its owner the following rights and has the following characteristics:

Direct profit share - proportional to the amount of tokens they hold. **Token holders as a collective receive 90% of all profits the bankroll generates from this token sale**.

Voting rights - Vote on which new games to build or features to add. Vote to reduce the house edge, if needed (**we offer our players a low 1% house edge**).

Are fully transferable - **You can return your HERO (ɧ) tokens back to us in return for ETH** (see our divestment schedule at http://etheroll.com/token-sale.html).

**Status:** OPEN  
**Duration:** 14 days.  
**Conversion schedule:**  
**Week 1:** 1 HERO (ɧ) token for 1 ETH (Ξ)  
**Week 2:** 1 HERO (ɧ) token for 1.5 ETH (Ξ)  
**Total # of tokens to be created:** 200,000  
**The token sale address:** 0xe709c6c933bda30963274d5bdd1e556c655c59fe

746,ethereum,"[ANN] First decentralized hedge fund, IBB DAO","Hi all, I would like to introduce you all to the first decentralized cryptocurrency hedge fund. It is an exciting time to be trading and investing in crypto.

**A brief history**
Wen, the founder of ibankbitcoins.com began his start in cryptocurrency with a venture to mine bitcoins in 2014. After KNC miner failed to deliver machines on time, a refund was requested and the refunded bitcoins started Wen’s trading in cryptocurrency. Carrying over 6 years of stock and index futures experience, bitcoin trading became very profitable. We took interest in ethereum since it released, participated in the crowd sale for Augur in the early days. then we started development of IBB DAO in February 2016.

**What is a decentralized hedge fund?**
Smart contracts on the ethereum network allows IBB to interact with its token holders through our decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Functionalities like issuing dividends, reinvestments, vote on proposals are hard coded into the contract and executed on the network.

**Performance**
Wen, our technical analyst, has generated over 180% of bitcoin return since 2014 with verifiable record. In addition, his ethereum trades since March is 108%. All trades are non-leveraged, not compounded and equal capital. While Wen focuses on longer term speculative trades, Jimmy, our software dev lead will be rolling out algorithmic trading across exchanges. Short term techniques include, market making and arbitraging.

**Security and Transparency**
We take security very seriously. Our first priority before launching is to have a security audit of our code by crypto experts and then open source the ethereum contracts. We plan to implement the following services to our token holders for transparency: Proof of reserve for cold wallet storage. Bit-go proof of reserve on live exchanges. With this, users can observe our fund’s holdings in real time on an exchange. Crypto financial audits by independent firms proposed by our DAO, disclosure of quarterly report on fund performance and holdings.

Our crowdsale will start soon, accepting BTC and ETH. Find out more on our website at [https://ibbdao.com](https://ibbdao.com) , learn about our DAO, fund management and past performance record. Ethereum contracts will be released shortly.

Edit1: subscribe to /r/ibbdao for news update.

**FAQ compiled from questions in the comments**

&gt; What is the advantage of investing your fund compared to buy and holding ETH/BTC?

Ethereum is in the growing phase coming out of beta. It is definitely profitable to hold on to ETH while it appreciates. However, just like with bitcoin, and traditional asset classes. It can consolidate, stall, turn bearish for an extended period of time.

When I started trading bitcoin in 2014, BTC price was 600, it is still ~600 today. [During the same period from my performance page](https://ibbdao.com/performance), you can see that the fund trades both directions, long and short. Therefore, during a bear market, the fund would actually make value instead of losing value by betting that it will go down. To summarize, the fund's performance is trying to capture the volatility of the price movement, both up and down.

&gt; Hard limit on token sales?

While we haven't ironed out all the details for the token offering, we don't have any plans to issue any additional tokens after the sale. We want to build our fund and brand organically and grow. If we do issue, it would be a brand new market segment and a proposal up for vote. It was bitcoin 2 years ago, ethereum now, who knows what people come up with in the future.

&gt; Is this related to TheDAO?

The slock.it, TheDAO is not related to us.

&gt; What kind of voting can you do with IBB DAO?

While we haven't finalized the details, the voting system can be used to do a few things we have in mind:

1. Financial auditors are voted by the dao, so we get independent auditors. They also write up the quarterly report.

2. Vote on the percentage to reinvest the money which will appreciate the tokens or payout.

3. proposal to fund other ETH funds, projects, alt coin trading. Currently only ETH and BTC

4. In the off chance the fund need to be resolved.

&gt; How do I know this is not a scam/ponzi etc..?

I don't expect you to trust an internet stranger. However, there needs to be some level of trust for devs whether its ethereum or some altcoin. That being said, we have been transparent since 2014. You can easily vet us yourself through our linkin, github, or any past trades. We offer a lot more for transparency compared to other crowd funds in terms of security and proof of reserve measures listed above. I personally believe in building a brand organically, just like I have with many traders on bitcoinmarkets, angel investors and twitter followers.

762,ethereum,Now deployed: A creator-utility for creating contracts using .call(),"I was testing the http://ethereum.org/dao framework, [trying to deploy a contract through a proposal](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/4273/possible-to-create-new-contract-via-a-proposal-in-the-ethereum-org-dao-framework), I had the idea that it was possible to do so and I wasn't able to. So I asked about that on [http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/5676/create-new-contract-via-call](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/5676/create-new-contract-via-call) and got the answer that `.call()` cannot create new contracts.

So, I wrote a sketch of what I call a Creator-utility that used inline assembly and the `CREATE` OPCODE, and [opened an idea thread here on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4nndkx/idea_creator_utility_to_create_contracts_using/), and u/i3nikolai and /u/peterborah continued on it and finished it.

    contract Creator {
        function newContract(bytes data) public returns (address) {
            address theNewContract;
            uint s = data.length;

            assembly {
                calldatacopy(mload(0x40), 68, s)
                theNewContract := create(callvalue, mload(0x40), s)
            }

            return theNewContract;
        }
    }

I've deployed one of these Creators on 0x02268047f5c77a6a533619773474d1a6e510443f on the mainnet ([verify code](http://etherscan.io/address/0x02268047f5c77a6a533619773474d1a6e510443f#code))

778,dogecoin,Greetings Dogecoin community! Need some help on our page which features dogecoin.,"Hello,

first let me congratulate you all for the spiked chart the last couple of days!

So, a while back I notified you guys of our [free vector page](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/3ghmuo/we_just_launched_a_site_for_free_vector_graphics/) accepting dogecoins as donations.. The dogecoin community where very helpful in pointing out flaws and errors in the language on the site.

Since then we have been featured on several places for example [archdaily](http://www.archdaily.com/), the biggest architecture site on the internet, we have hade more than 130 000 downloads, our best stat is 13 000 uniqe visits in one day... Now we also added a working facebook like counter that is increasing everyday.

During all this we have  proudly been reppin dogecoin by using it as one of three ways to [donate](http://pimpmydrawing.com/supportus.html).

Now we are going to try and implement a encouragement system for donations. What we are going to do is that everyone donating (&gt;10$) are going to get a chance to send their own pic in to us and we will turn them in to a figure that will be featured on the site. For this we need a text. So I am once again turning to you dear Shibes and Shibas if you could read through this text and let me know if you find any errors. 

&gt;**THANK YOU FOR THE OVERWHELMING SUPPORT OVER THE LAST MONTH!**
Since we got published on archdaily.com the appreciation and feedback we have received from you guys have been astounding. We are very happy that you like our work! 

&gt;The most common question we receive is when we are going to add more content. Believe us we want to. The problem is that two of us are working full-time and the third has switched career and is back studying full time. Therefore we are in a sever deficit of time... Yet far from depleting our libraries, for example we have cars! Really nice cars. 
We also get the question if we can accept figures from the community to publish on the site. In theory we love this idea. However there are two problems:

&gt;We cherish quality over quantity. We need time to make sure all content live up to our standars and are conformed to our ""rules"". This takes time to administrate and is honestly quite boring in comparison to draw new content from scratch.

&gt;Licensing - we are no law students and we don't know how to formulate a binding contract for giving up their copyright.
BUT we have a plan! This summer the one of us studying has a lot of time. For now the idea has been to find a job but maybe we can all benefit from her doing work on pimpmydrawing.com. It doesn't feel right to ask you for money so instead from now on everyone of you who donates 10$ or more will get offered to send a full-body picture of yourself and we will make a figure of it and feature on the site*. If enough people participate we will have one person working on adding new content during the summer! Thanks in advance.

779,ethereum,I wrote a 42 page spec for an online pharmacy. I don't know what to do with it.,"It took a couple months of on-off work to get done, but I wrote a spec for an online pharmacy. It's 42 pages and has some code (Solidity), some psuedocode and extensive discussion of the system and how it works.

I could code it myself (eventually), but I really need some help with reviewing the logic behind it all and thinking through implementation a little more. A single mind sometimes doesn't see all the problems.

Another thing: this online pharmacy might be a model for lots of other online markets. It's an experiment of sorts - if whoever builds and runs the pharmacy can solve fraud prevention and validate incentives structure, they can also build the exact same thing for nearly any other two-sided marketplace.

So I see three options:

1. Build it myself.

2. Find a partner to work on it with me.

3. Release it to the community to (probably) die.

What do you guys think?

(Eventually, I do hope to learn to use those frameworks etc. and become at least moderately familiar with front-end development, but right now it's just a distraction to me.)

So what I'm wondering is, since my app only needs about seven or eight different views, can I just write the CSS and HTML myself and interface with web3.js from those pages? Is there any reason why that wouldn't work?

It was 2 years ago already and their kids don't contact her no more. And she don't have any relative also with this place, so what I did is that I go to a small market, buy her breads, peanut butter and some clothes (which is cheap). And I asked her where she lives, she said on the street already, she can't afford the rent on the apartment anymore.

Seriously, this really breaks my heart, my day was really fine and relaxed and driving with cool music on it, and saw an old lady that was bullied because of a bread. Damn it. What is wrong to this world? She asked for a bread and no one even can give her, that's why she stole it because she was so hungry already. And her kids has no hearts, after the years their mom raised them, they don't contact her anymore, such a heartless kids whatever the reason or the problem is. That is your mom, you should love your mom.

And lastly I gave her $100 since I got that only into my wallet, and she got some foods at the small market, I am sure she was so happy she was hugging me crying and saying thank you.

I don't have any regret at all, and I was happy doing it, and my heart was like so happy like a real love to a person even I don't know her personally.

So I checked into it, for California, and got in contact with Territory Manager, Michele via email.

So, here it is. She wrote back:


**********************************************************************************
    Dear Tom
     
    Here is the price information.  Each highway has a different cleaning frequency which determines the prices. 
     
    Thank you for your interest in the California Sponsor A Highway Program.
     
    This program offers great public relations, low cost marketing and 24 hour- 7 days a week visibility.
      
     Your organization or  company name and logo would be viewed by thousands of cars on a daily basis reflecting your investment in the 
      community you are in, going green and helping the environment.
 
      This is a great way to capture the attention of your potential clients by placing signs in the areas they commute through.
        
      Each State Department of Transportation determines the cleaning frequency on the highways. 
    The cleaning frequency determines the price.
      We do the cleaning on your behalf for safety reasons- you get the recognition
        
       The CA Sponsor A Highway Signs are $ 275 dollars a month or $375 dollars a month depending on the highway  for the cleaning 
     fee and there is a onetime sign set up fee of $200 dollars to design, fabricate and install your Sponsor a Highway Sign. (Internet discount already applied).
         
        The CA Sponsor A Highway signs are   42” x 54” background panel with a sponsor panel of 21” x 45”.
         
        This is a very economical way to get your name out on the major highways for a fraction of the cost of a billboard!
          
        The signs are only one every two miles in each direction in CA. We would discount your monthly fee if you take one in each direction!
         
       The signs are available on CA State Highways such as I  5, I  10, I  15,280 Freeway, I   405, 605, Highway 101, Highway 508, 

      Highway 680 and the  South Beach Expressway to name a few .
        
        The CA On/off Ramps are $200 dollars per month per quadrant with a one time sign set up fee of $200.00. (Depending on the DOT requirements)
         
       The CA On/Off Ramps signs have a background panel of 36” x 30” and a sponsor panel size of “30 x 15”
      
      Please let me know if you need maps or available location lists
      
      They are available on a first come first served basis.
 







**********************************************************************************

**********************************************************************************

So, this is the California example (it might be more/less costly than another state, who knows). I remember reading on the FAQ that there was a 12 month commitment, but I see no such language here (maybe it's offset by the one time setup fee).

ok, idea. if you have legs, may ye start running now

I have to say, the developers chimed in and explained a few things that pretty much changed my mind.

1. The remaining roughly 95% of the Plutons that are not sold will be held in a contract and disbursed over a very long time. If verified, the contract will not let the developers dump any of the tokens, as they simply won't have access.
2. Plutons will be an actual purchase currency. Not a token simply 'transporting' BTC, but one actually acting as a currency for payment. 
3. They are aware they will most likely not reach 32000 BTC, and do not expect it. 

I am still not 100%, and Plutus.it might still be a terrible idea to participate in but I am absolutely more positive than I was 24 hours ago.

973,ethereum,Could the big banks release their own public blockchain that would subvert this one?,"Hear me out, now.  With all the talk about [R3 partnering with 40 banks](http://abruzzo.tv/news/2016/06/16/microsoft-launches-blockchain-fabric-to-help-enterprises/) along with Microsoft’s Project Bletchley, what if they’re all colluding to fork Ethereum and build a top down blockchain that would directly compete with the current one we know and love?  For clarification here are some rudimentary steps they could take to get there:

1. As the articles say, they’ll start by building a private smart contract layer that handles the higher-level central transactions between only them.  
2. Meanwhile Microsoft builds the identity smart contract layer.  
3. By now banks could tie personal and business accounts to blockchain accounts on their private network.
4. Large and small businesses that do business with the banks would soon already have accounts and credit history on this blockchain without their knowledge.
5. Big business could be cut in on the deal by migrating their accounting to the Big Bank Private Blockchain (BBPB). This would add further layers of smart contracts all in preparation for businesses and end users to be able to use their bank (now blockchain) account with other big business services.  
6. By now people are signing up for new low API credit cards and other new blockchain-enabled financial products offered by and through their bank and are able to interface all of it via their regular online account they’ve had for years.  Not to mention handling all of their (lower-cost than elsewhere) online subscriptions like Netflix, Comcast, Amazon, Costco, home purchasing, health insurance etc etc etc, all on the blockchain smart contracts of the BBPB.  


The banks of course would keep their node / mining software secret in the interest of controlling all nodes.  The above only outlines a superficial and brief overview of how BBPB could subvert the current public blockchain and there is much more that they could do to further that agenda that I haven’t gotten into--like new government arms building tax smart contracts into the BBPB. 


Perhaps (and I hope I am) missing something obvious that would render this approach moot.  And I’m hoping the community will point it out.  So please mercilessly pick this theory apart!",1466090628

992,ethereum,Where is the central NEWS from main developers? Too many unanswered questions.,"Hi guys, please don't take this is as FUD as I have 1. invested in ether and 2. integrated it into our websites as a merchant.  But what is most important to me is When will this POS shift happen are there any recent estimates on how this casper is coming?  Where the heck is the central hub of information from core developers at? cause ethereum.org is not very busy with new info. 

I am loving the speed of ether for our website and the smart contracts offer amazing potential but I'm far from being able to program that at the moment.  

I run an ether full node and noticed doing a personal_signAndSendTransaction returned insufficient gas as I left it to default and tried to sweep an account leaving 5 cents usd buffer for gas fees I was amazed that the fee was &gt; 5 cents usd (just yesterday) So now I tweaked the app and we allow for 10 cent usd for gas fee..  but it leaves me a bit miffed

Is there a geth or api command that can estimate gas needed? I need to automate this so i can simply manually recompute fees all the time LOL.. This is my frustration very hard to get support to specific questions. Maybe I'm not smart enough but I shouldn't have to be :( 

Is there a formula and way to query a dependable source on the blockchain stats to compute gas needed Or via my node? cause otherwise its a nightmare trying to sweep an account to achieve a zero balance.

Also is there a way a smart contracts for dummies tutorial anywhere?? 

I'm very excited about ether even though I hold mostly BTC as an investor but what concerns me is no HARD ROADMAP to inflationary figures.  Everyone uses the analogy of GAS but that's not really good.. Gas in the real world is CONSUMED but gas in ether is just shifted from one player to the next.. Unless I'm mistaken.. yet again another unanswered question leaving uncertainty.  If Gas is simply shifted from one to the next and never actually burned up then we need to FIX the supply (inflation rate NEAR ZERO). Without a fixed supply it PUNISHES holders of ether and that is counter productive. With wei 18 digits there is NO reason what so ever to even have inflation beyond maybe covering for lost coins.

Anyway hope some of you Ether Heads can point me in the right direction to more certain news from the core devs and a roadmap as well as how in the heck to computer gas etc etc..

Thanks guys (and gals)

Yet the balances have not changed. Although my Mist account shows, under transactions, that the ETH has been sent, the balance is still showing all that ETH as though it were still there, and the Wallet Contract address is not showing any ETH received.

It’s quite common for us to have older model iPhone and Android devices laying around after upgrading to new models. These are still fully function smartphones, they just aren’t the latest and greatest for everyday use.

So why not use them as offline transaction signing devices and have Jaxx offer an option to split the transaction signing between two devices?

Download Jaxx to both the old and new devices, the old device is then kept offline and used to generate the wallet seeds and create addresses as per usual. The new phone which is used normally online then syncs up the addresses to watch, using the camera to read the QR code of the generated addresses from the old phone.

When it comes time to perform a transaction on the new phone, go ahead and follow the usual process except once you get to the transaction signing stage it displays a QR code that you read in on the old phone, which in turn signs the transaction and displays a QR code for it that you then scan back in on the new phone to submit and process. The user can still backup their seeds and use the old device online as a full wallet in an emergency if they so choose. 

And even if you didn’t want to use it as an offline secure-signing device it would allow multiple people running Jaxx to work from the same address, but another person can actually sign the transaction when they approve it.

To my mind this should be simple, it uses the functions that Jaxx already performs and simply allows you to split it between two devices. The only extra module needed here is something to allow the signing to be handed back and forth between them via QR code.

Hopefully someone from Jaxx will read this and comment, I’d love to see support for this kind of feature to make an already **excellent** product even better and safer!",1466127404

Expect further updates inside the blog post (they will also be replicated here).

An attack has been found and exploited in the DAO, and the attacker is currently in the process of draining the ether contained in the DAO into a child DAO. The attack is a recursive calling vulnerability, where an attacker called the “split” function, and then calls the split function recursively inside of the split, thereby collecting ether many times over in a single transaction.

The leaked ether is in a child DAO at https://etherchain.org/account/0x304a554a310c7e546dfe434669c62820b7d83490; even if no action is taken, the attacker will not be able to withdraw any ether at least for another ~27 days (the creation window for the child DAO). This is an issue that affects the DAO specifically; Ethereum itself is perfectly safe.

A software fork has been proposed, **(with NO ROLLBACK; no transactions or blocks will be “reversed”)** which will make any transactions that make any calls/callcodes/delegatecalls that execute code with code hash 0x7278d050619a624f84f51987149ddb439cdaadfba5966f7cfaea7ad44340a4ba (ie. the DAO and children) lead to the transaction (not just the call, the transaction) being invalid, starting from block 1760000 (precise block number subject to change up until the point the code is released), preventing the ether from being withdrawn by the attacker past the 27-day window. This will provide plenty of time for discussion of potential further steps including to give token holders the ability to recover their ether.

**Miners and mining pools should resume allowing transactions as normal, wait for the soft fork code and stand ready to download and run it if they agree with this path forward for the Ethereum ecosystem. DAO token holders and ethereum users should sit tight and remain calm. Exchanges should feel safe in resuming trading ETH**.

Contract authors should take care to (1) be very careful about recursive call bugs, and listen to advice from the Ethereum contract programming community that will likely be forthcoming in the next week on mitigating such bugs, and (2) avoid creating contracts that contain more than ~$10m worth of value, with the exception of sub-token contracts and other systems whose value is itself defined by social consensus outside of the Ethereum platform, and which can be easily “hard forked” via community consensus if a bug emerges (eg. MKR), at least until the community gains more experience with bug mitigation and/or better tools are developed.

Developers, cryptographers and computer scientists should note that any high-level tools (including IDEs, formal verification, debuggers, symbolic execution) that make it easy to write safe smart contracts on Ethereum are prime candidates for DevGrants, Blockchain Labs grants and String’s autonomous finance grants.

I believe the best approach is to allow miners and exchanges to unilaterally censor transactions involving the ETH that has been stolen - with wide adoption this would effectively permanently lock up the ETH and ensure the attacker doesn't earn any money from their crimes, as well as preventing the ETH price from tanking due to the attacker dumping the stolen ETH.

I am convinced it will be entirely impossible to push through a controversial hard fork to bail out the DAO and if it does happen it will split the community and destroy the value proposition of the current Ethereum blockchain.

Edit: I support the soft fork as proposed by vitalik [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4oj7ql/personal_statement_regarding_the_fork/), it is the best middle way and the best way to prevent a hard fork from happening as it should be enough to remove the only legitimate argument for why a hard fork would benefit ethereum (prevent attacker from dumping ETH).",1466163706

&gt;The CALL opcode (used to send messages to other contracts, or send funds to non-contract accounts) will fail if it causes the call stack to exceed 1024 frames. This is not an exception: instead, the CALL operation indicates an error, instead of returning data from the callee contract

Early contract like Etherpot is affected by this(I think there was a reddit post but I can't find it):

https://github.com/etherpot/contract/issues/1

The fact that DAO was made by the same people that was part of Ethereum Foundation at one time adds insult to injury.

Now the solution is 'Let's Destroy Fungibility', which sets a bad precedent in the future.

TL;DR Please understand any reported security related issue and try not to repeat them. History doesn't repeat but it does rhyme.

This is just stupid. We should give the POS code (once its ready) at least 6 months to be reviewed over and over by multiple people to make sure it doesn't have a serious bug like the one exploited today.

Lets remove the difficulty bomb and rethink our approach to POS. A bug in the POS code will bring down the whole system! Just think about it.

That said, I recognize that there are very heavy arguments on both sides, and that either direction would have seen very heavy opposition; I personally had many messages in the hour after the fork advising me on courses of action and, at the time, a substantial majority lay in favor of taking positive action. The fortunate fact that an actual rollback of transactions that would have substantially inconvenienced users and exchanges was not necessary further weighed in that direction. Many others, including inside the foundation, find the balance of arguments laying in the other direction; I will not attempt to prevent or discourage them from speaking their minds including in public forums, or even from lobbying miners to resist the soft fork. I steadfastly refuse to villify anyone who is taking the opposite side from me on this particular issue.

Miners also have a choice in this regard in the pro-fork direction: ethcore's Parity client has [implemented a pull request for the soft fork](https://github.com/ethcore/parity/pull/1309) already, and miners are free to download and run it.

1131,ethereum,Clarification about Ethereum and the DAO (from experienced user),"Hi. My name is Andreas and I've been involved with Ethereum and developed on it since very early on. There are some confusing &amp; misleading posts going on about ""the DAO"", and also ppl are worried, so here is a (hopefully unbiased) post about some things that are good to know.


**Some terms**


*Ethereum* is the actual platform. 


*Ether* is the built-in currency. 


*The DAO* consists of two things:


1. A set of contracts (scripts) running on the Ethereum platform.


2. An organization made up to protect the scripts, and correct errors, since it is the first big organization of its kind.


**The problem**


Sombody found a way to exploit the scripts and change the rules for how Ether is transfered, meaning funds that are governed by those scripts are at risk.


**Solution**


Ethereum admins will go in and fix it.


**Issues**


The most pressing issues seem to be that:


1. A bug was even possible.


2. The intervention is bad because it means Ethereum is not truly decentralized (i.e. it's managed by a small group of people). 


When it comes to the bug, that is obviously bad, but there will always be bugs in computer systems; the issue is always how do you deal with them when they happen. This is true even for secure systems.


Many of the decentralization concerns has been lifted by bitcoin people, which makes sense, since they have seen their own network go from decentralized to centralized (it's now controlled by a handful of people). Bitcoin is great in many ways, maybe the greatest system for doing currency transfers to date, but it is not decentralized. Given that the protocol was set up with that goal specifically in mind, but the defacto network built on that protocol failed to stay decentralized, that means, unfortunately, that the protocol failed, which is not a good thing.


This however does not mean Ethereum will become centralized; particularly not because of an agreed-upon fork in its early stages. Forking is only done for these ""the DAO"" issues. There are other DAOs on the net, and if they fail, the response will not be the same. In those cases, token holders are on their own.


There can of course be other issues, and afaik Ethereum is not immune to the issues that centralized bitcoin either, but I don't believe this particular issue will have a lasting impact. In fact, I would probably be in favor of more interventions like this in the case of ""the DAO"" (or maybe a new DAO that the Ethereum group is behind). The alternative is to remove the training wheels completely and just let whatever happens happens.


**TL;DR**


Bugs are bad.


The value of DAO tokens and Ether will likely drop for some time.


The long term prospects of Ethereum has not changed significantly in my opinion. Bugs can and will happen, and there always has to be a system for handling it. In this case, the planned forks are ok because:


1. It does not apply to DAOs generally.


2. It was agreed upon well in advance.


The condition here is of course that the handling mechanisms are updated and that analysis and fixes are made, i.e. don't just fork and be done with it. 


**Additionally...**


You can't go from centralized to decentralized in one single step. Just look at bitcoin, which essentially did the opposite. The question is how do we do it gradually. The way many of us are posting and getting actual responses, and that Ethereum is changing because of it, has been very good imo, and shows that the system does work; however, things has moved very fast recently. The DAO in particular. Maybe even a bit too fast. I know many of us has felt that a reality check was overdue.


EDIT: Also this: https://blog.ethcore.io/attack-on-thedao-what-will-be-your-response/

If autonomous is more important, then the community needs to accept a very painful but important lesson.   How can smart contracts be trusted if it is just a new form of mob rule, where the community can reverse whatever is not politically or financially acceptable to the powerful?

So where is that tradeoff?   Are the two principles equal?   Is that even possible?  

This is a very important moment for Ethereum.   People will be analyzing the response for years to come.

**Proposal: Soft Fork to Disable Attacker,  TheDAO Pays the Attacker a Bounty**

* The Ethereum community soft forks (hard?) to allow the attacker to only be able to return his ETH to TheDAO.  
* TheDAO offers the attacker a modest portion of his theft to do just that.
* TheDAO then decides whether to liquidate or to keep going.

This is a blueprint for the Ethereum ecosystem as a community to solve what is an Ethereum ecosystem problem.  This should be good for everyone.  The attacker as it stands now will not be able to extract any value from his impressive feat.  ETH holders stand to see the value of their ETH crater more than 30% it already has and see all the naysayers trumpet that Ethereum can't work and is dangerous.  DTHs stand to see a liquidation of TheDAO at 70 cents in ETH terms, potentially compounded by the potential further drop in ETH/USD or ETH/BTC depending on how you measure your value.

**If the largest DAO craters, all your non-TheDAO ETH aren't worth as much.**

**ETH's Value is The Ethereum Community's Constructive Collaborative Nature**

The Ethereum community makes ETH valuable by making it useful and pragmatic.  This pragmatic, adaptive ethos has enabled massive amounts of ambition and also the mistakes that ensue.

#1: As an /r/Ethereum mod, censorship or threats of any kind won't be tolerated. Please message me personally and send a message to the Ethereum mods if you find any of that happening on the forum, even if it is by other mods (I highly doubt that would ever be the case). 


#2: Although people claim that if a HF happens it will  be centralized, HF's require community consensus and in the end all the Ethereum Foundation(EF) or even slock can do is push code and attempt to influence. You can argue that the influence of Vitalik or the Ethereum Foundation constitutes a central control, but it has been made very clear in recent Reddit posts by Vitalik and others that there will be no action forced upon the community by anyone with perceived power, especially the foundation and Vitalik. Furthermore, the community, for better or worse, has been relying on groups like the Foundation, Parity Team and Consensys to spend hours researching, publishing, and fixing Ethereum issues throughout the life of Ethereum. There will come a day where Ethereum will be widespread and strong enough for users to have more knowledge and power to directly impact protocol decisions (Proof-of-Stake will help), but that day isn't today and potentially ~13% of total ETH supply is at stake.


#3: Personal opinion: Softfork to stop the bleeding of the DAO and hardfork after 24-72 hours of research, thought, and testing. ~13% of total ETH in the ecosystem is at stake, so in times like these coordinated community HFs, while not ideal, are the best path forward. Let each of the different clients push their own proposals out through software updates (or coordinate on proposals) and the community/miners will decide the outcome.

1176,ethereum,The DAO's hack might be a good thing,"While everybody is freaking out because their money was siphoned off from the DAO, I want to make the remark that this event might be very good for the long term advancement of Ethereum and decentralized organizations as a whole.

The DAO, while fully operating is Ethereum's first major attempt at creating a decentralized organization. It's an infant project, and to expect an infant to not fall while trying walk for the first time is unreasonable. We should expect some hiccups as the projects like this progress.

The hacker revealed to the entire community one of the many possible vulnerabilities and left all the money siphoned off inside of child DAO account where the hacker can't withdraw the money for another 27 days. Therefore the money he stole was really temporarily displaced as long as the community can make a decision within those 27 days. The hack looks like more of a lesson by somebody with vested interest in Ethereum than a flat out thievery. 

Overall, this hack is telling us where to look for future failures. If Ethereum is to last in the long run, more vulnerability hacks need to happen like this. I propose that we create some sort of bounty system to make hacks more controlled.

If I were to use an analogy, the DAO is an infant in Ethereum.

1180,ethereum,My two cents on the fork debate,"[disclaimer: I have a few k$ in the DAO]

Hello

The question of a hard fork giving back DAO holders their stolen funds is a difficult one. On one side, it makes a lot of sense as the fork does not hurt other ether holders directly and can maintain a positive mood in the community -- avoiding a large portion of ethereum community to feel let down and disgusted. On the other side, forking creates a precedent that is not good for ethereum's reputation: how about next time a similar even occurs? how about next time authorities force the foundation to fork the transaction from a terrorist?

I want to clarify several points. First of all, saving DAO shareholders is not comparable to saving a bank. When politicians decide to refund a dying bank, they use others' money to do so: yours and mine, that we contribute through taxes. By saving a bank, they are arbitrarily deciding that steeling my money is for the better good, i.e. that the money of me and my friends is less valuable than the well-being of a corporation. It is hurting me. In the case of the DAO, nobody is hurt by a hard fork, as the money used to fund victims back comes directly form the pockets of the thief. This big distinction makes it difficult to compare the hard fork proposal to the saving of TBTF banks.

In addition, refunded TBTF banks, 1) will have no incentive to operate better in the future and will probably go on acting like a state-backed hedge fund, 2) and their clients won't even understand the high risk situation that occurred -- and the fact they should stop trusting third-parties -- and will therefore continue to use banks. With ethereum, I feel we can agree that even in case of hard fork, 1) the DAO is dead and cannot profit from the fork or operate maliciously with the recovered funds, 2) the community is smart enough to take this as a final lesson and never invest so massively in an experiment. I myself will never do this mistake again and will be more conservative in the future.

Now from the reputation point of view, we should not forget that a hard fork is not bad per se. If the large majority of ethereum nodes/users agree with the hard fork, then it is close to a non event. Certainly, we've settled a precedent, but at the same time if the community wants this precedent, then the fork defines Ethereum. If the community is split about the fork, then market forces will probably force one of the sides to abandon its view and join the leading fork. This would be sad for the community -- and the market price as well as trust in Ethereum would be impacted -- but this is how free market works. The sanest decision being in my opinion to indeed fork ethereum, create this unfortunate ""precedent"", but at the same time remember that ethereum is still in its early phase, which can allow difficult decisions for difficult events, as long as the community stays together.

There would be nothing more terrible for Ethereum than a split in the community, so I hope we will converge to what I think is the least-bad solution of forking. Our community has been our strongest asset until today, I sincerely hope we will avoid the tensions that our friends on r/bitcoin have suffered from.

1205,ethereum,Investors in the Rouleth : Don't worry we seem to be immune to the DAO attack (and other possible known threats ),"Hello there !

Althought, I'm pretty sure we will recover easily and that this will be an incredible learning opportunity, I was shocked by the news of the hack of the DAO smart contract.

As a developper, I can say that Ethereum is a real challenge for us. The smart contract are a new paradigm we don't master and understand completely yet. But at the same time, it allows no mistake ! Most parts of a smart contract can't be modified once it has been uploaded and there is often a lot at stake on the contract. That's why we have to patient, accept this trial and error process and welcome bugs as learning opportunities. Also I think it was maybe a bit too naive to stake so much money on a software 1.0 of a new platform, but it was a macro effect we did not anticipate.

The whole thing inspires me those 2 quotes :
""What does not kill us makes us stronger"" and ""Rome was not built in one day"".

Anyways, appart from those personal thoughts, I also wanted to **reassure the investors of the Rouleth that the contract is safe and not vulnerable to the DAO recursive call bug.** I have updated a list on my github with all the known threats to smart contracts and explains how I built protections to make the Rouleth secure.  https://github.com/Bunjin/Rouleth/blob/master/Security.md

And also thanks again for your support for our game !

**Contract Security :**
   
   Following the DAO hack, ethereum users have realized that the security of smart contracts is something that should not be taken lightly. The hack of the DAO was performed due to a flaw in the smart contract and is not at all a bug of ethereum.
   The rouleth contract incorporates several security features that makes it secure against several potential attacks on smart contracts that have been identified by the community. I will list those potential threats below and explain how I secured the contract against them.
   
   1) Recursive call attack : (DAO ATTACK) --&gt; ROULETH IS NOT VULNERABLE
   http://vessenes.com/more-ethereum-attacks-race-to-empty-is-the-real-deal/
   The attacker exploits the fact that when a contract sends ether to another contract it also executes the code in the destination contract. If the destination contract is malicious, it could try to ask the first contract to send the money again. If the first contract does not update the balances before sending, the attacker is allowed to withdraw several times a single amount.
   The rouleth code is immune to such attack for several reasons. First of all, all balances are updated before the money is sent. So even if the attacker was able to call the rouleth contract again for a second reccursive withdraw, he will not be able to withdraw more than his total balance. 
Second, since we use basic send() functions in the rouleth contract (and not call() like in the DAO), the rouleth would not send enough gas to the attacker contract, so the attacker will not be able to execute the rouleth functions again.
Third and most importantly, we always check if the player/investor is allowed to call the function before we allow him to. So for instance a player that tries to spin the wheel recursively, to win multiple time his payout for the same bet, would not be allowed to. When a player spins the wheel the first time, the contract changes the progress of this user from ""waitingForSpin"" to ""waitingForBet"" and since the spinTheWheel function always check that the user is indeed waitingForSpin, he will not be able to call it a second time.

While it is an unfortunate situation, I support Vitalik's position.  

But we must learn from our mistakes.  A lot of supporters of decentralization will pound the table that we must not interfere and that the precedent will ruin us forever.  I am not in that camp.  The network is still in beta.  Ethereum will be stronger if the situation is rectified and the supporters are not thrown under the bus stubbornly based on principal.  Unlike Gox, which was a major setback to the bitcoin ecosystem (customers, investment, press, etc) we can fix this.  We've come a long way and the fact that there was a solution proposed within hours is a testament to that.  I am confident that it will be refined over the coming days/weeks, but its HUGE progress comparatively.  Everyone should express their opinion but I hope that this becomes a lesson learned and not a suicide.  I hope we don't alienate our customers.

Looking ahead, we'll be better off with hundreds of focused DAOs vs. one massive conglomerate / holding company.  The economy will function better that way.  The DAO was an ambitious project, but why create something that poses systemic risk to the community.  Start small...Digix, Augur and others are making great progress and the DAO governance concept will improve over time, but its better to invest in a focused product/startup than a conglomerate.

Even if a lot of people may loose money (not only the guys who have DAO), it should be not done.

It should be independent from the smart contract it runs. 

If one contract has been poorly coded and there is a flaw in it, why Ethereum should care ?
It happened in the past and it will happen in the future.

The DAO contract is not the only one that has/will have vulnerabilities. 
So why make a soft fork just for the DAO and not for another contract in the future ?

It opens a door to something we don't want: biais, centralization, exceptions, etc.
It's a matter of trusting the whole project.

I hope the miners will choose not to fork, else I think the whole project is killing itself.

1220,ethereum,Changing the DAO contract post-hoc risks court action,"Thesis: The ""attacker"" in the DAO ""hack"" and had the rules changed after the flaw was exploited. The code that was written **was the contract**. Therefore, changing it now opens up the DAO to court action for contractual violation. 

Consider how a conventional (non-ether) contract: two companies, A and B, wish to merge. the terms are outlined in detail, including a $5 million penalty for party B if it doesn't happen. The contract is signed, but the merger falls through. Party B is on the hook; period. Did they think the contingency would never happen? Too bad. Did they read the contract while distracted, and miss it? Too bad. In court, in the status quo, this type of consequence is absolutely enforceable. And it should be in the ethereum universe, too. Failing to let the contract play out as written is an unbelievable moral hazard that nobody in ethereum should be willing to take.

The whole point of ethereum is to have an inviolable contract **in code**. The fact that the counterparties didn't read the contract carefully enough is not anybody's ""fault"" but their own. I feel terribly for everyone who failed to read the fine print, but... they should have read the fine print!

Someone else on another site likened it to George Soros breaking the bank of England... it's a great analogy because one person is ""attacking"" or being aggressive in their bets against the status quo, but there is absolutely nothing illegal about it.

This event is a watershed event for ethereum, even though the DAO is just one element in the ethereum universe. As the biggest entity (by far) the culture of ethereum will be profoundly affected by how the DAO is allowed to proceed. Voting with your software to change the rules will absolutely tie up the question in court, and shackle ethereum to the status quo system of conflict resolution... an outcome that none of us should be willing to flirth with.

We told people that cryptocurrency is better because it's absolute and unforgiving. They told us we were stupid and immature. Well guess what? We built exactly what we wanted, and now we are clamoring for a do-over. Nothing could be more damaging to the community and technology at large. Another ethercoin might come up in the future, but it will lack the credibility that ethereum has, and might fail as a result. 

This is our chance. The lesson is incredibly painful, but we need to suck it up, learn from it, and emerge from the other side stronger than we were when we started.

In the future, perhaps contracts should have an explicit ""override by majority vote"", so that clearly unintended and malignant behavior that is contrary to the intent of the code but within the letter of the code is correctable.

1227,ethereum,The DAO is not being bailed out,"When I woke up this morning to the infancy of this chaos, (now settling nicely into a kind of angry toddler phase) I was interested to see how the broader community would react to all this. Among all of the concern of centralized decision making (something that is NOT happening in this scenario) has sprouted an odd objection; that The DAO is being bailed out by The Ethereum Foundation. 

I firmly believe this is a misnomer of the ""bailout"" term, and misleading. 

Developers are suggesting (not forcefully deciding) that the network be proactive in ensuring that one party is not able to take what was yesterday, roughly a quarter billion USD from thousands of others. You can argue that The DAO contract is working normally, but not only is the contract *CLEARLY* being used in bad faith by a bad actor, but outside of things like social engineering, hacking in bad faith is pretty much always an example of code working precisely the way it was written, and someone exploiting it. You could even effectively argue that social engineering hacks are simply exploiting fully functional systems. 

If a theif figures out how to open your car using keyless entry codes that your key fob broadcasts, it's not reasonable to decide that your car wasn't really stolen. Clear acts of bad faith are not meaningless in determining what is and is not a crime. 

But back to bailouts. In recovering money that is clearly stolen, no bailout is being proposed. Funds recovery is not funds expropriation. If The Foundation had actually proposed taking funds from users unconnected to this theft, that would be different, but no such *proposal* has been made. There is no call to take something like 15% of all ETH balances on the blockchain to compensate DAO Token Holders; only a call to return what was clearly stolen. 

I believe this is a rational solution with minimal impact on the ecosystem. In the days ahead, we'll hash more of this out and be in a better position to know if this is the proper path forward, but I firmly believe it to be. 

Full disclosure, I hold a not insignificant amount of DAO tokens, but I am entirely confident that I'd hold this position otherwise.

This is still a consensus network. The police aren't going to do it, because we are the police. There's something we need to decide. It isn't every decision in the future, its only this decision right now. 

This decision is whether or not you want to let thieves steal innocent(albeit naive) peoples money. That's it. We aren't putting Trump, or Clinton or Bernie in charge, or creating a Fed Reserve. We collectively stopping a thief, because if we the people who control this capital don't there isn't anyone else who will.

1233,ethereum,The balance to find for the fork discussion.,"Some thoughts about the overall game theory of the situation.

 * losing about 10% of all existing ETH to a thief is a disaster for PoS
 * bailing every DAOInvestor (including me) 100% out would create bad incentives. There should be a loss for investing in unsafe contracts.

As far as I know is the draining from theDAO still possible. It stopped (from my observation) simultaneously with the blog post of Vitalik where he discussed the idea of a soft and a hard fork. This makes perfectly sense from the perspective of the hacker. Of course the hacker is not interested in creating too much pressure by stealing all funds to make a fork more likely. I would even predict if consensus around a fork would grow the hacker would offer a deal to send x% back (to avoid the fork) This would in my opinion be a favourable solution - however - it would require to built up the pressure for a fork first.

However - if we would agree on a hard fork I think a 100% bail out would be a mistake. People (like me) investing in unsafe contracts should loose money. If we would have already a better (decentralized) governance solution for the foundation (or any other public good) we could do a hard fork where e.g. 70% of the ETH is returned to DAO investors but 30% goes to a public good.

Last thought - if there is a white hat hacker who can replicate this attack - I guess that would be a good way to bring the funds in a DAO where they can not be attacked by everyone.

Part of the reason some folks contributed to the DAO was with the hope that it would fund projects that strengthen the Ethereum community.

In response, just a suggestion that we might all consider donating some ETH to the Ethereum Foundation to give them additional funds for DEVGrants. 

My opinion is that while the Ethereum VM might need to be Turing complete, the safest financial contracts perhaps should be written in a specialized contract language that contains all kinds of safeguards (preventing recursion, etc). Slock.it mentioned in April that the DAO framework had been audited by an outside firm (https://goo.gl/4bgY5K). That was a good move but it seems like even that was not enough. 

Here are a couple of links for contract specification languages, in case anyone finds them useful.

**How I Identified the Hacker**

Origin address can be seen here: https://etherscan.io/token/TheDAO?a=0xc0ee9db1a9e07ca63e4ff0d5fb6f86bf68d47b89

You'll notice a number of repeated transactions for 25,805.6141471 DAO which is the recursive function. This matches the 258.05 ETH bleeding from the DAO into here: http://etherscan.io/address/0x304a554a310C7e546dfe434669C62820b7D83490#internaltx

This address has voted yes on a couple of splits [59,64], followed by moving the DAO tokens after the voting deadline here: https://etherscan.io/token/TheDAO?a=0xca04d260356d19f0d7255041542c9cbc866f2cb3

The new address then votes yes on an additional 4 splits [69,70,71,72]. The tokens are locked here for the next 3 hours, after which I predict the tokens move to a new address to vote on additional splits.

If i'm not mistaken, the hacker then has 27 days to call the SplitDAO function for each proposal to attempt the hack in each of the newly created DAOs. Now each DAO has a stalker problem where a minority stakeholder can drain ETH.

Would love to get some opinions or thoughts to protect split DAOs from getting hacked. Would also like to know if the proposed forks would also protect splits in addition to the main DAO.

**Edit - Tracking the Hacker**

The address which initiated the hack (0xc0ee9db1a9e07ca63e4ff0d5fb6f86bf68d47b89) received all of it's ETH from one address: 0x969837498944ae1dc0dcac2d0c65634c88729b2d.

If you write a smart contract and execute it and it is ""exploited,"" is it actually exploited? What will determine that? 

What about actual law? Ethereum is EU, Slock.it is EU. But what about the person who ""stole"" the ether? I mean if you can figure out jurisdiction, and I were a judge, I'm not sure where to even begin here. You ""wrote"" a contract...it was executed...

In law, if you write a bad contract you are still bound by that contract. And then it also brings into question non-lawyers writing code that is meant to behave like a contract. And if it isn't a contract, you certainly chose a terrible name to call it. 

What about the fact that perhaps there isn't enough distance between Ethereum founders, those that works at Ethereum, the DAO, and all the companies Ethereum founders either own or sit on the advisory board of? It taints the whole thing, as I'm sure many of them have money in the DAO as well.

1266,ethereum,A thought I had on cryptocurrencies and stolen assets over a year ago...,"Bear with me on my fragmented thoughts...

I've spent a lot of time thinking about cryptocurrencies in the past years, one of the the thoughts I had was concerning theft.

My thoughts were, you know with today's at large FIAT monetary systems, people can do shady things for money, they could steal, mug, even kill other people. This money, lets say its US dollars, goes right back in the system, because there's weak means of control.

I imagined, in an ideal world, people would be disincentivized from committing crime because you can see where that money is coming from and going- especially large crimes.

Imagine large crimes going on right now in US dollars. Multi-billion dollar crimes. It can be hard to track them, or prevent that money from re-entering circulation. And of course nobody wants that money re-entering circulation, but there's little you can do about it (right now).

Right now, we have a very unique opportunity. The crime that has been commited is isolated (that money has not re-entered circulation). We have a tremendous opportunity to correct and clearly do what is right. 

This is what I think the future will consist of, whether you like it or not. And personally, this is the kind of system I would prefer my money to be in (especially, if, again, it hasn't been mixed into circulation and thus there is no trail of money between different parties that complicates things). (And naturally I would like to be able to chose the controllers of my money- rather that be forced to accept a certain government with all of its policies).

I guess we have a choice here. We can do the right thing and create a powerful positive statement in cryptocurrency, or I fear this event will haunt Ethereum for years to come (""Ethereum, oh you mean the one that got hacked and people lost millions?"")

1268,ethereum,"Aug. 15, 2010: Bitcoin Network Hard Forked To Erase Transactions Generating Billions Of Fraudulent Bitcoins. Very Few Even Remember This Now, No Harm Was Done, The Same Will Be True Here","Many of you are up in arms that hard fork to install a contract that will allow the return of the stolen DAO funds will destroy the network. This is not true. Very few people remember when BTC hard forked to preserve the value of everyone's bitcoins and prevent the market being flooded with billions of fraudulent coins (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bitcoin). Just as that hard fork did not undermine bitcoin (despite many people saying the same thing then, as they are now that the network will be doomed and untrusted), a hard fork to return stolen money from a criminal will not undermine ethereum. 

You can say this was a network issue for BTC and the DAO's issue is not a network issue for ethereum -- that is only superficially true.  The fact that professional security audits and hundreds of the best minds in ethereum did not catch the issue makes this, for all practical purposes, equally as much a network issue as a poor code issue.  Bitcoin was opensource afterall, why didn't everyone just say SFYL you should have found the bug in the bitcoin code if you were going to use bitcoin. The similarity is a large scale software issue that affects nearly everyone on the network, not a protocol vs non protocol issue. This is also unlike Mt. Gox in that we know exactly where the stolen money is, and it's fixed in place -- there was no possible programmatic solution to Mt. Gox, here there is. This is much more like the hard fork from 2010 that saved bitcoin's value. 

Now, we can either devolve in a toxic group of individuals sniping insults at each other, much like the blocksize debate as done to bitcoin, let that toxic environment cripple the network, or we can remain a cohesive community and fight the criminal. We can let everyone from the non-crypto world more steadfast in their disapproval of us all and let them say this was a huge quarter billion dollar mess-up proving crypto is bad, or we can come together as a community and show that the crypto community has real-world solutions when bad things happen, and it's not just a big huge SFYL. 

In the end a hard fork needs consensus, and is simply another example of the network working as programmed. If it gains enough consensus from miners and the community, then the system worked -- it's not a failure of any sort. ",1466187441

Let me start off by saying that I only put enough into the DAO that I could easily afford to lose. I saw this was a completely risky investment and knew that I could stand to lose all my money. I have no problem losing my funds because, hey, thats what I signed up for. However, this is not because the DAO was ineffective, its because the DAO was compromised from the start and 14% of the entire supply of ETH can be potentially in one persons hands.

This is bad any way you look at it. VB's solution for a fork rollback is being criticized by some as being a 'centralized' approach to fixing this problem. It's not. The only way that a rollback can be executed is if 51% of the miners agree to run the code and that would be **thousands** of people all coordinating their individual resources to revert the theft. 

Some say this will turn people away from ethereum. I disagree. I think that this approach will be encouraging to new users that see that the ethereum community can come together and fix massive problems nimbly and safely. The alternative is to let the hacker keep tens of millions of dollars worth of ether that could potentially be dumped on the market in the future, only compounding the DAO failure and bringing the virus to the ETH main host.

2. All TheDAO investors were properly warned about risks associated with investing

 https://daohub.org/explainer.html
&gt; RISKS:
The DAO concept is both experimental in nature and unproven. There is a risk that, as an open source project, any contributor to The DAO’s software could introduce weaknesses or bugs into the DAO software, causing the loss of DAO tokens or ETH in one or more or even all of the DAO Token Holder’s accounts.

3. Thief does not deserve these coins either
Taking away money from safe that was suposed to be locked, but it wasn't, is basically still a theft. Period

4. Allowing the thief to keept the coins is not an option also because with such large amounts of coins, he would have tremendous voting power once PoS is deployed.

5. Getting involved with TheDAO was wrong course of action, and as such deserves to be punished. They made a concious choice to invest, took the risks, and got called. Destroying coins punishes them properly for poor decisionmaking

6. Not getting involved with theDAO was apparently the right course of action, and as such it should be rewarded - since theDAO ether will be destroyed, rest of coins will become more scarse, and thus more valuable

Having all coins destroyed:

- prevents hacker from dealing further damage

- punishes theDAO investors for their ignorance/incompetence/risk management

- rewards people who kept away from that project

- prevents creating To Big To Fail type of institution",1466192534

Balance of above contract is currently **10 ETH**: when you send **0.1 ETH** or more to it (with a gas limit of **100000**, unused gas will be returned) a 256 bit random number generator is triggered, and if the generated value matches with a predefined lucky number the entire balance is paid back.

Let's see if someone manage to cash it out, of course there's always a very small probability of hitting the correct number out of pure luck (theoretically 1 out of 10^77 - the entire universe is estimated to contain about 10^80 atoms).

1343,ethereum,Someone please offer a good reason why you would not hard fork in this situation...,"I am struggling to understand the resistance to a hard fork in this situation. It seems to me some people are being dogmatic in their belief that a major theft from The DAO should be allowed since intervening would ""create a bad precedent"". 

The problem with this line of thoughht is that it assumes some kind of action for a hypothetical event while completely ignoring the precedent that is set for this actual event.

I think we can all agree that what happened here was theft and that it is morally wrong. Given that, we can derive the actual precedence set by the following actions:

Hard Fork - Future exploits likely discouraged as it is shown the community is willing to take action to reverse major thefts. Trust in good faith of the system.

No Hard Fork - Future exploits likely encouraged as it is shown that there will be no action even for major thefts. Clever hackers will be rewarded at the expense of trust in the system.

1351,ethereum,The DAO Hack: Recovery and a Brighter Future,"Fellow Members Of The DAO Community,

As I’m sure you are all aware, The DAO was attacked earlier today and the community is coming together to explore how best to move forward. We would like to extend our support to the community by doing what is necessary to retrieve the stolen funds. If there is any way our project can help, please let me know via private message. 

At this point in time, we are refraining from posting the Tronn proposal but will do so as soon as the larger issues have been dealt with. Let’s not forget the story of Bitcoin. The digital currency that many said would never catch on was reported dead multiple times after the Mt.Gox issue. It took time to recover, but at present Bitcoin is thriving in the $700-780 range and shows promising signs of reaching levels unseen since before the incident. 

“Success is not final, failure is not fatal, it is the courage to continue that counts.”

We believe this is a genuine setback, but not the end of The DAO initiative. During this time, it is important to remember we must keep calm and act reasonably, not out of fear or anger. Code will be modified, systems will be updated, and yes there will be a loss. If we unify behind this cause instead of splintering under the pressure, The DAO will evolve into something better than it was before. We need to look no further for reassurance than the original project to experiment with this level of freedom, innovation, and empowerment: Bitcoin.

1361,ethereum,Forking will not set a precedent,"Many seem adamantly opposed to any fork on the grounds that we sacrifice immutability. Further, that this sets a precedent that may invite government agencies to demand forks in the future for whatever they might want to do. 

This is absurd.

Forks (soft or hard) require consensus. They always have, and they always will. The only reason that this DAOsaster is even an issue is precisely because we have this option that is otherwise normally insane to even ask for. We all know that it's absurd to make a request like ""I sent 10 eth to the wrong address, please miners, fork. My mother needs operation.""

We know that's absurd, because we understand a strength of crypto is resisting manipulation by those who benefit from fraud. Who knows if your mother needs an operation...but if you could make your case in such a way to convince the miners that you were legit...well then that absurd request actually becomes 100% legit...and that's why this doesn't set a precedent.

It has, from the beginning of blockchain, been the case that miners can agree to state changes of the ledger, and the ledger system. This is nothing new, and has ALWAYS depended on the consensus view of the legitimacy of the requested changes. If the miners decide that it's a legitimate move to make DAO token holders whole, it is a decision that is 100% technically similar to every single other fork that miners have made. 

So what about government requests for forks? Well, they can make those requests today. They've always been able to make those requests, and that won't change, no matter how The DAO debacle is resolved. The fact that this is even a contentious issue should show us what a useful tool the use of consensus is in our toolbox. 

Tl;dr: we have all always been able to request forks, and forks are nothing new. The only reason this fork is even being discussed is because it's infinitely more legitimate to users than would be any gov't request for politicized financial censorship. ",1466199353

1368,ethereum,My take on DAO hack: To Fork or not to Fork?,"After considering both sides of the argument, I will explain why I believe that a hard fork won't have the negative consequences discussed today. Fear of reputation damage caused by a HF was my initial reaction as well. But I changed my mind. I think the hard fork is, ""on balance"", the best way forward.

I believe that the success of Ethereum will not depend on its reputation. ""The masses"" will adopt if value is added for them. The first mass dapp on the scaled PoS chain wont remember any HF just like Bitcoin services don't mind that Bitcoin once forked on its own! 

Also, this HF won't be a central thing, miners and community need to agree before it ever happens. Now if it happens, it doesn't mean the community will do another HF if the government wants it. Miners simply wont go along with bad intentions. You can't force a HF.

So if the network as a whole decides to fork because of a large scale failure in this ""early stage"", to me this is on pare with forking to update from Frontier to Homestead. And it doesn't mean that Ethereum is now not immutable. This function remains for dapps in general. 

If we stick with this chain and ""let the market decide"", then the money would be lost. Not a big problem in the long run, but in my opinion will cause more short term reputation damage than a hard fork. 

A technical fix wont be as much iterated in the news as a perceived theft would be. An HF would spawn more news like ""Theft resolved after hack"".

And don't think developers won't trust Ethereum anymore, rational people understand what happened and they will still have incentive to build cool things on a cool platform. 

To wrap up with my opinion on the DAO: The idea is amazing indeed, but it is to big. I love to let go of the idea that the next thing needs be a major overwhelming service that dominates, but rather small things that many people use everyday. The ""Low hanging fruit""

DISCLOSE: I wont mind losing my DAO tokens, I have 10% in there. But this is my honest take. Please comment

1372,ethereum,Some logic amidst the panic and fear - Ethereum + The DAO,"* There have been multiple threads of people who some how support the exploit used as part of the original smart contract?

* The whole idea that you can steal money and pretend that the technicality of it makes you not guilty. Is what has the judicial system so crippled and open for subjective manipulation, things are easy until lies are involved. It's very clear if you look at it truthfully - the hacker took what was not theirs to take, making excuses for this is pandering to an onslaught of unnecessary thinking and justifying actions which were unloving to begin with.

* Ethereum is directly impacted by the DAO - this hack stole more Ethereum than all of the whales combined, pretending that deploying disassociation through a layer of justification somehow precludes you to a direct impact is not logical. Thinking that this somehow does not impact Ethereum is fruitless, When a hacker who has direct control over a mass of Ether tokens can directly manipulate Ethereums' PoS plans as well as the market in general.
* Look at how immediate and closely tied the response is between the respective prices of both Ether and the DAO / this is a fear induced response involving both not feeling safe and other idealistic stances, now compound that with a hacker owning the majority of ether and tell me how this bodes well for Ethereum on the whole?
* We should **FIRST** try to resolve the issue without a roll back - which is the responsible thing to do given the specific set of circumstances in this situation.
* If it is deemed that the DAO simply is not safe and this will continue to be exploited from other hackers then a decision has to be made.
* *If no other option is left after the allotted time then a very clear and direct explanation for why a roll back is necessary can be presented to the community in a clear and palatable way, explaining why this was not some flippant decision but rather a calculated choice made on a clear set of circumstances.*
* In the early days of bitcoin an exploit was found and bitcoin was ROLLED BACK, this does not mean the experiment failed. Bitcoin grew and became more robust - though the example is different as this situation is somewhat unique, it holds value when examined.
* Try not to allow your fear to control your actions, we have a community of brilliant people and solutions are being investigated. No one here is powerless, we have options and are investigating them.

Vitalik has become the target of much hate and FUD - try to be compassionate when you are quick to post your hate/opinion. Consider this, if you were in his position. Would you like to be spoken to in this manner.",1466200903

Given that the thief must be both intelligent and have already invested a considerable amount of time and energy into ethereum, I think he will take whatever opportunity is presented, after all soft fork/hard fork/whatever, its clear he is never getting that ether. 

Perhaps a soft fork which only allows all the ether in the stolen split be sent in one go to a smart contract which redistributes the ether back to the original senders. This should be sufficient incentive to the thief, who could then buy up all the heavily discounted DAO tokens, or just take a leveraged long position in ether itself and exploit the fact that he is the only person who knows if he will bite or not?

This is a problem, and a big one at that. Next time a hack happens, who would buy Eth? Plenty of people will want to sell it (as people get scared when such things happen).

That would push the price to 0, and as a community - we lose everything.

I know some of you will say - that is what they get for buying stolen goods, but.... they could not know, and if they could not know... anyone buying up during a crash can not know.

Many of these are from wallets created by outdated software which produced so-called brainwallets, which have since been recognized as insecure. 

Given enough weeks or months of trying, some of these wallets have been hacked and emptied. In some cases, this has been 10k-50k of ether, which represents a substantial amount of value. 

Let's assume the simplest case scenario, where a wallet has been hacked with a single transaction sending its balance to a new address, where it has not moved from since that time. And let's assume it would only apply to cases where there was very clear evidence that could be presented that this was indeed a hack of this kind.

Obviously we can't make a habit of forking for the sake of recovering funds for hacked wallets, but assuming we do get ahead with a hard fork, would you be for or against also including a one-time reversal of wallet emptying attacks as well, and why or why not? 

The argument for including them would be there is not much in principle separating them from what has happened with the DAO. This means, arguably, that not including them would indicate the picking of winners and losers for political reasons, which is one of the main toxic elements we have seen in the well-publicized cases of ""Too Big to Fail"" bailouts of banks.

Or is it that we don't really know if it's lost or not?

If NOTHING was truly lost, then this is a credit to the DAO, not a shameful thing. To survive a terrible attack such as this and recover smoothly should give you MORE confidence in the DAO, not LESS.

This is why something makes me think something else is going on. Either the claim that nothing was lost is a white lie or there's something more fundamental with the DAO that caused it to fail.

1418,ethereum,re: the theft; you all seem to miss a point,"I am not tech savvy, but as I understand the situation there seem to be these two options:

act so as to shut down the stolen funds

or not to do this.

The sentiments being thrown around are like these:

'If we do not shut this down, the DAO holders will be screwed and this harms Ethereum.'

or

'If we shut this down, we are setting a precedent that will harm Ethereum.'

Or, more succinctly,

'They wrote a contract.  Someone used the contract.  Everything is working as intended, from the perspective of Ethereum itself.'

Here is a gilded quote in another post:

""I disagree. Smart contracts don't have ""intended uses"" published with them, and nor should they. I see no reason to believe the person who started the recursive split wasn't behaving perfectly legally and running the contract according to the way it was written. Bringing in arbiters to decide what's good and evil makes smart contracts a useless and embarrassing joke, which is why I sold my ETH.

I really don't care how much money was involved, whoever put funds in the DAO deserves whatever execution of the DAO give them. That's the whole point of smart contracts: the contract decides.""

This sentiment seems to be widely shared; I think we can describe this sentiment like this:

'It's all code all the way down and up.  Tough luck to whoever didn't read the contracts well enough.'

The question no one appears to be asking:

""Who has the money?""

Do you suppose the only people who have a vested interest in the resolution of this situation are those in the Ethereum community?

Do you know how many guns can be purchased with one hundred million US dollars?

Okay, I can understand that people in the community may not be concerned with whether they will have blood on their hands after the stolen funds are unlocked.  Nevertheless there is a pressing concern here:

there is a possibility that LEO, the Wrath of God, will become involved supposing we do not insure that such vast sums of money cannot simply become unaccounted for.  Something like the DAO ceases to be an interesting toy when it comes to be the executor of funds adequate to fuel a terror campaign in perpetuity.

More than DAO holders being screwed, or bad precedents being set for the future, involvement by LEO into Ethereum would be catastrophic not just for this project but for cryptocurrencies in general.

Anyway, just a thought.

And honestly, my stance doesn't matter, but maybe my insight will be useful to someone.

I've been financially involved in Ethereum for about 10 months now. I'm a small guy, I don't really matter. I personally didn't invest in The DAO because it was too new and too risky for me. I'm never an early adopter. I never jump onboard new, exciting, and unproven things. Instead I opt to miss early opportunities in favor of observing while other people risk their money and time. 

However, just because these early adopters risk their money on a whim, instead of due diligence, does not make them useless or dumb. There is no way any of them should have been expected to have found this bug in The DAO before investing. There were A LOT of people looking at The DAO and, if I'm correct, it wasn't found until over a month after The DAO was released.

And I want to remind everyone, it's early adopters, like our DAO investors, who greatly advance this technology. They are willing to take great risk in untested technology created by unknown developers. If it wasn't for people like them, Ethereum wouldn't exist. Altcoins wouldn't exist. Practically every lesson we've learned over the years would not have been learned.

So this is a big Thank You! to the early adopters of The DAO. I am being sincere when I say that. Thank you for taking risks so I don't have to. Thank you for advancing this technology by supporting the devs ideas. If you guys aren't made financially whole at the end of this, I hope you'll at least become mentally whole and realize how helpful you have been to our community. Thank you.",1466209165

So when the value of my Ethereum suddenly dropped I couldn't really explain why.

Then I read the events of 17-06-2016 am.

150 million USD of ethereum potentially to be stolen by hack on the DAO?

Let em burn was my initial response; anyone following the Ethereum news knew the DAO had serious vulnerabilities; warnings were given in advance that the DAO was flawed and risky.

Exactly why I didn't get involved in it.

I thought the DAO was stupid in implementation; an oversized mistake waiting to happen. But I left them be because in the end I think Ethereum is bigger than the DAO and able to survive it, regardless of what happens.

So the real dilemma for me became an ethical one; let em burn, lose money and punish them the hard way for not responding to warnings on DAO vulnerability much sooner.

Because in money if there is an exploit, someone will take it.

But then I thought; if there was a reset switch which could revert a crime then the victims won't get hurt but have an opportunity to learn from their mistakes:

Going too big, too fast and not paying enough attention to the variables.

So I sat back.

I'm not voting on this. I'm not taking a side but here's a thought:

If I were a big investment bank looking at Ethereum technology, looking at what it could do and how it could power my financial processes to save time, improve efficiency and make money would I not be reassured that such a switch to undo such monumental cock ups was at hand?

Personally if I was a big bank and that reset switch was pulled on my observed experiment when it went wrong during early development to take it back to a place in time it was working so I can fix the bug, I would have more confidence in the product as a whole.

Knowing that the safety switch is there and that there is an option to take it is the ultimate reassurance in the long term (as long as it's ethically used).

Either way I think this event marks a show of strength for ethereum as it has shown the outsider world looking in that it has a chance to recover and right it's wrongs in the face of massive catastrophe even if it doesn't have to.

That's an exceptionally strong thing; allowing your system the opportunity to learn from mistakes and grow without destroying it completely.

Personally I think the DAO should disband following this regardless of how it plays out.

Personally I hope future builders of DAO like systems will pay more attention to what came before them and be acutely aware of what problems can occur.

Personally I believe this will slow the growth of Ethereum in the short/intermediate term but long term much like BTC is currently winning out, so will Ether (unless BTC becomes like Eth).

But personally I think these are two different things.

Vengeance and retribution or compassion and forgiveness?

I'll be watching closely, but this time I'll be holding onto my Ether regardless of outcome.

1438,ethereum,The DAO fork IS NOT a centralized bailout. Ethereum's community IS a DECENTRALIZED JUDGE.,"Lets see what a bailout is:

* A SMALL NUMBER of officials hold a SECLUDED, SECRETIVE meeting

* They decide to print new money AT THE EXPENSE of the general population

Now lets see what this fork is:

* EACH MEMBER of the Ethereum community can choose to accept or reject the fork. The decision is made by a SUPER-MAJORITY.

* The fork will only move EXISTING money

Think about it like this: the Ethereum network is a distributed smart contract platform. The Ethereum *community* is a DISTRIBUTED SMART JUDGE that can enforce the intended spirit of said contracts.

Apparently, some contracts are not very smart... But I hope the community as a whole, the decentralized judge, will be.

More thoughts. ""How can I know what the intended spirit of a contract is?"", some say. ""It's just code! It has no intended spirit!"". Well, in Ethereum's case I think that approach is wrong. Ethereum's purpose is not to be a sterile VM in vacuum, running code just for the sake of running code, without any regard to real world or human consequences. It is BY THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE. And if people are stolen from (and that's for the distributed smart judge to decide), it should do what's in its power to make it right.

Some more thoughts. A fork is just an option for the decentralized judge to decide on. By definition, it gives each member of the community a choice. I don't understand why some people object to any fork at all, even in principle. They are just taking options off the table and limiting other people's choices. If you don't like it, don't run it. Others might like it and run it. Eventually, the majority will decide. Objecting all forks will not get rid of the decentralized judge - Ethereum's community is inseparable from Ethereum.

Some even *more* thoughts... ""It's a slippery slope!"" they say. ""Going forward, how can we have confidence in Ethereum?"". Well, to me, the fact that a distributed smart contract platform comes bundled with a distributed smart judge is actually reassuring. Also, Ethereum is still very young. We are still experimenting. Bitcoin had a [hard fork](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident) in its infancy, and is still alive in kicking today.

Lessons would be learned: much more scrutiny for contracts and not allowing any single complex contract to hold more than 10 million usd, and so on, and the community might emerge stronger. But is a big might at this point: community very divided right now and it seems many can't see past their own nose.

I would understand if it was an issue with Ethereum itself but this issue was a 'private company' and they coded it that way.

If the coins would be damaging to Ethereum during POS why don't they just blacklist the coin. Otherwise people are going to abuse this refund by buying tokens on the exchanges for -45% and getting +45% profit. This should be a free market.

Without decentralization, the blockchain is just a fancy database that wastes far too much electricity.  My solution?

The foundation needs to implement in code in the hard fork to save the funds of the dao, it's own demise, or it's own replacement.  As a miner with about 1 GH, I won't be pointing it at any forks that don't implement this.  They were too involved in the DAO, and the conflict of interest is obvious.  They need to resign gracefully, and mathematically prove they no longer have the power to centrally control this ecosystem, even if its just by there influence.

I chose Ethereum a few months ago as the platform for developing a fintech concept/business. The reason why I chose Ethereum is the ability to easily create smart contracts that could be used to promote honesty and integrity in financial markets. The inability for humans to override or manipulate transactions resulting from the smart contracts is THE selling point for me as a businessperson.

It is obvious to me that a hard or soft fork to make an individual company's investors whole completely undermines the primary selling point of Ethereum, and by extrapolation, Ethereum-based businesses. The long-term effects of such actions will be mistrust in the underlying smart contracts in any Ethereum-based business. This is a long-term negative for the technology and the Ethereum-based business ecosystem.

I briefly looked at the DAO several months ago and for several reasons did not choose to invest any funds in it. From my perspective, as someone working on an Ethereum-based business, the DAO is simply another business. It is not a central bank and it is not too big to fail. Whether or not a ""crime"" occurred is not a question for the greater Ethereum community to resolve. My understanding of how the DAO works is that the DAO stakeholders can submit proposals for how to handle the hack - within the DAO (not across the entire blockchain).

Is it out of the realm of possibility for DAO members to propose funding an investigation and IRL criminal proceedings if they can prove a crime occurred? If someone rips off Goldman Sachs (or any other company), they are responsible for using any legal means they can to recover their funds and prosecute criminals (if a crime occurred). It is not the responsibility of other corporate actors, market participants, or citizens to make them whole again.

Maybe my ""newness"" to ETH and my lack of investment in the DAO is not allowing me to see an important detail here. But it seems that the DAO is solely responsible for recovering its own funds through the courts in whatever country the ""crime"" occurred. And that future DAO's need to have proposals to hold funds somewhere to help it recover damages / investigate crimes IRL when they occur.

Eroding trust in all smart contracts (and by extrapolation all Ethereum-based businesses) in order to make the investors of one business whole again seems short-sighted at best and potentially fatal to the platform at worst.",1466224729

We have witnessed the first notable failure of a smart contract.  In the wake of this disaster, something profound happened: the nascent flame of a decentralized legal system has materialized.
I’m going to make some imperfect analogies and overbroad generalizations in this post, but hear me out nonetheless. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Smart Contracts and Dumb Contracts Aren’t so Different After All**



One lesson learned today is that smart contracts are not so different from dumb contracts.  Parties typically do not enter dumb contracts because they are intent on breaking them.  Rather, parties to a dumb contract intend to be bound by the terms of their agreement.  That’s not so different from a smart contract.  We all entered into a smart contract expecting it to say what we thought it should say, and expecting others to act as they promised they would act. 

&amp;nbsp;

Sometimes contractual agreements do not work as planned.

&amp;nbsp;


Humans have been breaching contracts with one another since dawn of civilized society (and probably long before that).  In modern society, when someone believes that another person has broken a promise, he or she may file a lawsuit to redress that broken promise.  To date, there has been no mechanism for resolving a dispute involving a smart contract, because we all intended for the code to govern.  But what happens when, like we have seen over the past few hours, the code doesn’t work as planned?



Nobody knows, but it’s looking like the answer might be very similar to a situation wherein a dumb contract is written incorrectly, contains a mistake, or is, for lack of a better term, buggy and broken.

&amp;nbsp;

**Parallels Between this Smart Contract Dispute and Hundreds of Years of Dumb Contract Disputes**




In American jurisprudence, we have a principle of contract law called mistake.  The doctrine of mistake may come into play where one or more parties to a contract screw up.  Maybe they totally misunderstood what was being negotiated.  Or maybe they agreed to one thing, but accidentally wrote something else into the contract and signed that contract without noticing the mistake.  



Put way too simply, if a mistake that goes to the contract’s very core was made, that contract might be void *ab initio*, or the aggrieved party might have the option to void it.  That sounds a lot like what the community is seeking to accomplish with a hard and/or soft fork, doesn’t it? 

&amp;nbsp;

See where I’m going yet?  No?  Let me try another example.

&amp;nbsp;

American jurisprudence also has a concept called frustration of purpose.  Frustration of purpose occurs when an unforeseen event undermines a party’s principle purpose for entering into a contract, and both parties knew of this principle purpose at the time the contract was made.  In certain situations, if the contract’s principle purpose is frustrated, the parties to that contract may be excused from performance.  This is pretty similar to hard forking the blockchain and unwinding today’s events, no? 


There are plenty of arguably applicable legal doctrines to the situation at hand.  Some, like those described above, focus on when something goes terribly wrong with a contract that nobody could foresee. Others deal with scenarios where malicious third-parties interfere with a contract.  Regardless of the situation, the law of contract developed because sometimes things just don’t go as planned.  Today we learned that smart contracts are not immune to the same problems that have plagued dumb contracts for centuries. 

&amp;nbsp;

Then, something really interesting happened when the community tried to craft a fix.

&amp;nbsp;

**People in the Community Started Acting a lot Like Decentralized Lawyers**

It should come as no surprise that the ethereum community did not come to an immediate, unanimous agreement about how to move forward.  In the face of this disagreement, members of the community started making arguments in favor of some positions and against others, not unlike the function of attorneys in today’s judicial system. 



Even more remarkable, we started citing to past precedent as if the principles of stare decisis should somehow guide the community’s consensus.  I’ve seen some point to Mt. Gox as an example of why no fork should be implemented.  Others responded by pointing to the implosion of NXT, which failed to implement a fork after a significant hack.  And some took the academic approach: they opined on what we as a community *should* or *should not* do, as a matter of basic policy.  This was fascinating to watch.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Miners May Serve as the First Decentralized Judge and Jury**

Ultimately, it’s up to the community to decide how ethereum proceeds.  This will likely be done by a vote of the miners.  In civil dumb contract lawsuits, the verdict is determined by a preponderance of the evidence, i.e. 50% +n.  This is not so dissimilar to how consensus works on a blockchain. 

This is obviously not a perfect comparison, but it’s absolutely fascinating to watch this develop. 
Despite all the uncertainty, I think one thing is clear: you, the members of the ethereum community, are now the judge and jury presiding over the first major smart contract dispute in human history.  Do not take this responsibility lightly.

But those people seem to forget what a fork means. Its a choice. If people don't go along with it and exchanges do not accept it as new reality, nothing changes. If on the other hand the miners and exchanges (I guess the exchanges are the most important players here) side with the fork, the DAO thief can still keep all his ether - in his parallel universe where nobody wants to play with him.

1505,ethereum,Who reimburses the ETH holders who lost money as a result of The DAO's screw up?,"I'm not trolling. This is a serious question meant to elicit a hopefully-rational thought process. Who reimburses the ETH holders who lost money as a result of the DAO's screw up? 

The answer, of course, is nobody. ETH holders invested in Ethereum at their own risk, and a bad event occurred causing the price to tank. How come, then, is this level of maturity and responsibility not applied to those who invested in The DAO? 

There are three categories of actors who should be bearing the weight of this responsibility:

1. The DAO creators. Hindsight tells us they wrote buggy code, code which let millions of dollars be quickly siphoned out the back door.

2. The DAO investors. They invested $150MM in an untested product without a healthy relationship with risk. Hindsight tells us they took a risk, and it went poorly. 

3. Last but not least, obviously, the person or people who siphoned the money. As an aside, it's not 100% obvious that the Siphoner acted outside of the social contract (not the smart contract) provided by The DAO. The DAO's own statements maintain that ""code is law"" and any loss incurred as a result of that code is purely the responsibility of The DAO's investors. Through this the DAO's creators have attempted to shift responsibility -- at least legal responsibility -- onto their users.

Back to the point: It's very important we don't absolve these actors of their much deserved responsibility. Stephan Tual's reputation should be shot for this. Investors who handed millions of dollars over to immature code (i.e., The DAO) should be aware they took a huge risk and lost. The Siphoner, if at all possible, should be held accountable for the loss they've rightfully caused everyone to incur. It's important to the integrity of this community to hold these people accountable.

We can't just swoop in and make it all better with a hard fork. Even if the hard fork dissolves The DAO and sends all the Ether back to The DAO's investors, who are we helping? We'd be letting the DAO creators and its investors get off scott free, devoid of responsibility. We'd also be sending a message to the Siphoner that no harm was actually done. ""It's okay, we patched things up and we're fine.""

But that's the thing. Damage was done. Reality happened, and whether we like it or not rewriting the blockchain's history won't help hold these people accountable. We can't change Ethereum's PR nightmare and we can't correct the price changes that caused Ether to drop 30% as a result of the DAO's code.

And that's the kicker which no one is talking about. That 30% price change potentially lost more value than The DAO was worth.

So, that brings me to my question. Who reimburses the ETH holders who lost money as a result of the DAO's screw up? If the answer is still ""no one"", let's stop acting like we can rewrite history and instead hold people accountable for their actions.

There are basically 3 proposals that I've seen.

1. Hardfork to return all funds to the DAO
2. Softfork to freeze the stolen funds (but not return them)
3. Do not fork at all and let the thief keep their winnings

There are strong feelings for and against these proposals but
I think the vast majority of people are arguing their side because they want Ethereum to continue to thrive.

If there were a prediction market that definitively showed that one of these proposals was better for the ETH/USD trading price, I would certainly switch to supporting that stance. Is this type of thing being done?",1466233426

1526,ethereum,Watching the debate surrounding the principle of blockchain's immutability vs the principle of justice (disagreements on what is 'just' aside) reminded me of an interesting case in philosophy of law. Humour me if you're interested.,"In [Riggs v. Palmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riggs_v._Palmer), ""knowing that he was to be the recipient of his grandfather's large estate, Elmer, fearing that his grandfather might change the will, murdered his grandfather by poisoning him. The plaintiffs argued that by allowing the will to be executed Elmer would be profiting from his crime. While a criminal law existed to punish Elmer for the murder, there was no statute under either probate or criminal law that invalidated his claim to the estate based on his role in the murder.""

Now I know that massive theft of the DAO's funds doesn't constitute murder (though I liked /u/umowo's points on the danger in allowing a thief of clearly questionable morals to make off with millions of dollars), but it will go down as an exceptionally difficult dilemma in the history of Ethereum, just as Riggs v. Palmer did for legal theory.

*How* do you account for a flaw in contract law that hasn't yet presented itself as a clear problem to be addressed? In Riggs v. Palmer, what was dictated by the absolute word of the law intuitively did not seem to be the just decision.

Should we be able to invalidate or circumvent certain laws when the result contradicts the original intention of the law? After all, creating precedents is not something to be taken lightly, for fear of trivialising one of the most important foundations of civilised society. I think people's opinions on the answer to that question may correlate with their opinion on the course of (in)action to take following the DAO heist.

I'm not interested in swaying your opinion on it either way. In my opinion a soft fork freezing the Ether so that no one can access it is a good middle ground of not allowing the thief to profit from a flaw in a smart contract, the security/technology of which is in its infancy and is clearly still very vulnerable, and not letting 'investors' get off the hook for the risk they took on. Anyone who put enough money into the DAO that, if lost, would make a significant dent in their portfolio is a fool, and must learn from their mistake.

If you think this is somehow bailing out the creators of the DAO, don't worry, their reputation is already severely tarnished...or at least those who have shown any lack of professionalism...

In writing this post I'm only trying to contribute to the interesting conversations on principle that have arisen from this whole debacle. I like that there is now a big spotlight shining on the security of smart contracts. In its current state and with the current knowledge base, it's clear this technology is a very long way off having contracts like a will be put in the form of a smart contract. 

In Riggs v. Palmer, the court's majority opinion ruled in favour of invalidating the murderer's claim to the estate, despite dissent among some judges in favour of upholding the word of the law. I don't like some people's naive adherence to the immutable logic of code, and if you hold that opinion I ask you to consider how complete inaction on a Mt. Gox-level event would appear to those who have no idea what blockchain is, i.e. those we hope to eventually adopt the technology.

If this technology grows mature we might actually enforce law in smart contracts one day.

1535,ethereum,We should play this by the rules,"First of all guys, this really really sucks. A black swan event has happened, but we have to look forward. 

In the type of scenario we find ourselves in at the moment there is no perfect answer to the problem. It's either going to be pragmatic or idealistic; we return the funds to the DAO token holders because in human terms 'it is fair' or we decide the blockchain should be immutable and don't allow a refund. There will never be a 100% agreement in te community on what choice should be made. However, the outcome of the choice is going to effect the future of Ethereum in a major way.

Even though I'm a big DAO token holder and I was really emotional about the event of yesterday, my opinion is that we should stick to the idealistic rules of a blockchain. The only cases in which Godlike interventions of a hard- of soft fork may be implied on the network are when they 1) bring new features, better stability or security, or 2) are needed to secure the viability of the Ethereum network from a threat.

When playing by these rules I conclude that we should soft fork to stop the hacker ONLY when it's a threat to the Ethereum network if one person or group owns the amount of Ether stolen. And by that I don't mean a threat to the Ether price when the stolen Ether hits exchanges (it just means redistribution of the Ether to new buyers), but a threat that could compromise the Ethereum network in PoS for example. If there is no realistic threat to the network, then the hacker won. Period. Furthermore, I conclude from the rules that we should never hard fork with the only intend to return funds to DAO token holders.

We are human. We have feelings about ethics and unfairness, and we are used to Godlike interventions from institutions and governments on databases and systems when something goes wrong or is injustice. In cryptoland there is no right or wrong, there is just code. I know, that's scary, but that's the path we chose by investing in Ethereum or The DAO.

as someone less invested (not financially invested at all) in ethereum or DAO i think that today is a horrific day, but whatever choice your community makes you'll probably be fine in the long run.

my advice is to leave what has happened and moved on. if you soft fork you will probably be ok anyway, but given that it is only 4% of the total ether it's probably not worth it in the long run. bitcoin has suffered far worse and just shrugged it off as a result of immutability.

1545,ethereum,"Bank bailouts, unstoppable contacts, currency protection, consensus, and you","**On bailouts:**

Bank bailouts made the banks whole. Nobody has advocated making the DAO whole. In all proposals, the DAO is allowed to fail.

So please let's stop calling this a TBTF bailout.

**On uncensorability / immutability:**

Regarding the ability to run ""uncensorable"" code:

The blockchain is ALWAYS the final word on legitimacy.

If the consensus of miners is that your transaction or block is not valid, you should expect to be censored. Everyone knows this.

Likewise if the consensus of miners is that your contract or code is not valid, you don't get to run it. **Everyone should also know this.**

It should come as no surprise to anyone that if I discovered a magic transaction that would pay me everyone's Eth, that transaction is likely to be stopped or reversed by the network. Likewise if magic code is discovered that steals Eth or DDoSes the network, that code should expect to be censored.

Blockchains are not uncensorable. However they do enjoy the benefit of *decentralized censorship* which is extremely censorship resistant.

So let's please stop promoting ""unstoppable"" code or ""uncensorable"" transactions because *these never existed on any blockchain ever* and start discussing the way blockchains really work, which is decentralized consensus on legitimacy.

**On directability:**

This does not mean that a judge or legislator can direct the blockchain to censor. It's decentralized: there is nobody who can be compelled to censor. Only the blockchain consensus mechanism can permit the censorship.

**On protecting the currency vs making investors whole:**

The consensus mechanism exists for self preservation. The reason censorship is being discussed is that there is the possibility of an existential threat if the thief holds sufficient Eth. I'm not saying I agree with this conclusion. However there are two parts to the proposal AFAIK:

1. Soft fork to prevent the thief from moving the coins

2. Hard fork to redistribute the coins

It's important to note that these are independent steps:

Step 1 protects the money supply and effectively shuts down the DAO

Step 2 makes investors whole

It is definitely possible to have step 1 without step 2.

___
**TLDR:**

No bailouts have been proposed, the DAO is dead

Consensus determines legitimacy. No code or transaction is ever guaranteed to run if it threatens the network. This is true of all blockchains.

No law or judge can compel censorship *as long as mining is decentralized*

The currency can be protected *without* making investors whole or setting up risk of moral hazard

I used Poloniex (extremely nice interface!) and MyEtherWallet to do the transaction.

I'd rather not have my private key visible on screen/on the clipboard etc. to maximise security, but if someone could confirm this that would be great. Is it okay to access MyEtherWallet on a PC to reveal the balance. I use Windows and have antivirus/malware etc. but you can never be too sure. Is best practice at this point to only use a dedicated linux machine which is purpose built only for Ether? I know there are no phone apps at this point... or am I being too security conscious?

I've reviewed your contract and do not consider it valid. Therefore I am making the decision not to enforce it.

Your refer to the code of your contact as authoritative. This is a fallacy.

According to the code that is responsible for administering your contract - namely, the code that mines the Ethereum network, each miner has complete discretion to decide for himself which transactions to include in a block. As miners we have the ability to decide not to recognize your transactions as valid. You knew this when you made the decision to manipulate the contract, so that was a risk you took, which appears to have backfired.

You are welcome to pursue your case in court. Good luck with that!

Sincerely,

A miner

___

Edit: excellent and thought provoking conversation all around! Thanks!

This has nothing to do with the morality of supposed theft or the original intent of the contract vs the code as written with bugs. That's not the issue here. The reason I consider the contract invalid is because I believe it is unenforceable: if the attack is an existential threat to ethereum then honoring it requires me to take a ""suicide pill"". **Any code which can be weaponized against the network is invalid** in my opinion. Others may disagree.

The attacker is welcome to pursue legal action with me, one guy, in another country, who signed no contract with anyone and who is running open source code that allows me to modify it at will. I will simply point out to the court that by the attackers own logic (""the code defines the rules"") then he must also abide by the higher order code that mines - or invalidates - his contract.",1466248239

It was an archived post I couldn't upvote! I shouldn't have to die at -2. :P

""
I don't think you clearly understand wallets.

A wallet is just a number. Expressed as a Base58 private key. You can store this anywhere, including, as /u/peoplma pointed out, in your head.

Everything else, and I mean everything, is bells and whistles and BS. There are two risks to wallets, and only two. Losing the privkey, and having it stolen.

The risk of theft is low, but may be made greater by poor practices, including choice of container for a wallet. Online wallet containers come immediately to mind, where a website being corrupt or compromised can lead to theft of keys and coins.

The risk of loss is greater. Every container has both advantages and vulnerabilities. A mobile phone wallet is convenient, but lose the phone, lose the wallet. An online wallet with strong security is handy, but forget the passphrase and you're screwed. Printed paper wallets are super-secure, but get them wet or burnt, and they're gone too.

That's why I was promoting the idea of altering privkeys in a way only you know, allowing them to be more safely stored, online and off. I put up a million doge in such a wallet, gave plenty of clues, and did not change the checksum (because doing that would have made it impossible to crack in the allowed timeframe). And it STILL took some very good people with lots of computing power 12 days to crack it. And what had I done? Merely swapped a few of the characters around, that's all.

You want a hardware wallet? Make one. Stick the key on a USB stick in a hidden file. Or encode it on an RFID chip or mag stripe card or engrave it into a strip of metal. Or paint it on a rock and bury it. All are equally effective, if not equally convenient.

1590,ethereum,Thoughts on DAO soft fork solution,"As I understand it, the proposed soft fork will invalidate any transactions to the DAO and Children.

So how about a slightly modified soft fork which would:

* Invalidate transactions from all but one (known, trusted) address within the DAO.
* Allow us to use the whitelisted address to re-exploit the split recursion 'bug', and drain the DAO safely.
* If any owners of non-malicious addresses associated with the Child DAO used in the attack have been identified, a second address can be whitelisted and the same process can be used to safely extract ether from the Attack DAO as well.

Funds could then be transferred to a refund DAO (minus my 10% hehe).

1591,ethereum,The Child DAO is 100% more capable of accepting proposals - I support it's existence,"The parent DAO wasn't even working. The Child DAO is the best thing that could happen to it, and totally contradicts my first sentence because it was the only thing in the DAO that did work.

It was IMPOSSIBLE for anyone to even reach the curators, I contacted some Slock.It members on LinkedIn, I've sent messages to Vitalik, I was in the DAO slack room for weeks on end. I've been in the cryptocurrency space for 4 years, and owned just enough DAO to submit proposals, what chance did other people have of getting influence. **Even VC backed SKUchain's proposal was dead on arrival.**

THE CURATORS/SLOCKIT ONLY ACCEPTED THEIR OWN PROPOSAL during the entire history of the DAO. There was a backlog of 250 (?) proposals, all of which weren't going to make ANY of the DAO token holders a profit in a decent time frame. There were governance proposals, and private company proposals with no plans of creating shareholders money for 10 years.

I have a proposal in the works that would make a profit, NOW, and I would totally submit a proposal to the new child DAO. If I could join the child DAO split at this point I would solely to submit a proposal to it (I honestly haven't investigated it, but from my understanding there would be 26 days to do so?)

**THE CHILD DAO, as demonstrated, IS INFINITELY MORE COMPETENT AND CAPABLE OF ACCEPTING PROPOSALS** 

If everyone else decides to use a new cryptocurrency because of this, then by all means, that is always an option for your network, I might buy that new cryptocurrency in the near term because it sounds like it will be EVEN MORE scarce than the network currently called Ethereum is.

If not, I will join the new DAO and make an awesome ROI for everyone involved and demonstrate the future of blockchain executed investments.

Each of these will have different repercussion for the Ethereum.

For example, Griff Green tried to explain the hard fork (I do not think he is the right person to do that, BTW), he said something like ""like the DAO never existed"". That is very worrying, because it means that anybody who ever touched DAO in any way, would be affected. Anybody who left the DAO via legitimate split (burning the tokens), who bought or sold DAO tokens for any other crypto or fiat currency, etc. It would affect much more than just DAO contract. Please tell me that this is not what it planned, because that would definitely be the end of Ethereum (IMO).

Even the soft work is not that easy - there are many ways of doing, with different effects. I still don't understand what Jeff's pull request would do, since it has a magical transaction hash: 0x7278d050619a624f84f51987149ddb439cdaadfba5966f7cfaea7ad44340a4ba, and I don't know what this transaction is. It does not seem to exist on the blockchain yet.

My first reaction was to suck up the losses, let the hacker have his day and be done with it.

But with the hacker holding 5 percent of all of the Ethers it simply isn't worth the risk.

Why would we allow the ethereum network to be compromised by letting someone like that owning such a high percentage of ETH and giving him the power to attack the network again in the future?

All just because of some vague ideological reason like: ""The idea of a smart contract is that it can't be controlled or changed by anyone, the contract = the rules""

Let's zoom out a second and look at what Ethereum is. Ethereum is a decentralized computer, a network, that can run financial (but also other) applications. It enables us to have programmable money, something that opens it up for a thousand different killer apps. A DAO is just one possible app.

The system is in beta, but so is the community. The community has to go through mistakes in order to learn from them. 

Are we going to allow such a learning mistake, a bug, are we going to allow it to compromise the entire network and future of Ethereum solely for some ideological reason that actually has no effect on the system itself?

That would be the biggest mistake for the Ethereum community to make.

It's simple: we hard fork, effectively taking away the power of the bug abuser to cripple the network in the future with his disproportional amount of ETH tokens - which are in the first place tokens to run programs instead of a store of value -.

Let's not forget about that: 

Ether are tokens to run programs on the network. 

We are caring too much about its value this early. **Let's forget about the money part for a second** and **let's think about whether  we really want someone with negative intentions to own 5 percent of the ETHER tokens so the purists can be proud**.


The only reasonable thing to do for anyone who believes in Ethereum is to secure the network and protect it from people with bad intent, at this early stage. Ethereum isn't even online for a year yet.

The ideological argument ""It would kill the believability of Ethereum"" is false. Ethereum doesn't need to be ""believable"". Ethereum simply needs to be a system that executes well-written programs and just works. **If it can run average applications day-to-day it will automatically become usable and therefore believable.**

As long as the network isn't being compromised by bug abusers that hijacked a significant amount of ethers in the early days to weaken the network in the future, Ethereum is going to be perfectly fine. It will remain reliable, it will execute programs, so ETH tokens will increase in value and the price goes up.


Ethereum does not need credibility, it simply needs to execute programs.

A hard fork to fix the core protocol without rewriting history is acceptable. A hard fork to rewrite history to protect someones mistake is not acceptable.

If the community of miners allows a hardfork to change a supposedly immutable contract running on ethereum, then all trust will have been lost in ethereums immutable integrity. What business will create anything of substance on ethereum if they know they can have their digital assets taken away if the miners so decide.

But if this is not done then one malicious individual will control an unexceptable amount of ether, destroying trust in the network in a different way. Ethereum was appealing to many because of its egalitarian dispersion of currency compared to bitcoin with satoshi controlling 1/20th of all btc. This is alot worse than sataoshi's stash. One malicious actor (who is known to NOT have lost his private key) controls 5%-10% of all ether. And this doesnt even begin to talk about the implications for PoS, with less than 10% of eth expected to stake at any one time and one person owning more than 5% the implications are obvious.

Either way ethereum will have lost an enormous amount of trust.

The only solution (if this is even possible) is to somehow make the dao and all dao tokens/ child dao tokens redundant/ frozen, by the dao itself voting to make it so. Is that even possible? I have no idea.

All I know is I will take my loss on my dao tokens to save the integrity of ethereum!

1632,ethereum,Change of EVM to support robust contract programming,"Just to start a discussion of various ideas if we are allowed to change the EVM.

One of the problems is internal state change in combination with re-entrance. A simple transaction can trigger a contract function that can do unexpected things like recursive calls. A small but crude solution could be to disallow recursion between contracts. I am not sure how big of an impediment this would be to the current contract design.

A better solution would be to use functional programming with no side effects. Aside from being more robust, it has the advantage making it easier to use formal proofs. The disadvantages I can think of could be lacking support in the EVM, as well as  some programmers being less experienced with functional languages.

Obviously, some side effects are expected from executing a contract, but that can be handled by returning a new state. The state is thus changed only if the function returns properly. There are a couple of states that has to be supported: Local contract state, ether transactions and blockchain changes (new and deleted contracts). Maybe I forgot something here.

Ether transactions are returning a result. If the result is ignored, it will not be done. To make sure it is done, it will need to be merged into the outer returned state.",1466261275

-people still seeing a rivalry between eth and btc, thinking they can't co-exist


-Greed, someone wanted quick profits (shorting 3k btc on bitfinnex) or to buy cheaper eth

What personally has surprised me and made everything even more confusing are:
The reaction of the community. The drama about hardforking. Only having a negative view on everything, making sure that's what media will pick on instead of the fact that thanks to our community members and the creators were able to halt the stealing and deal with the retrieving of the coins, thanks to precautionary code that makes them unattainable for 27 days. And instead of being thankful that wrongdoings can get undone, they pick on the fact that this is possible and that it is really bad for ""decentralization"". 

It really pisses me off to be honest, all the hate in these communities and towards any other idea or project out there, even between subreddits. Instead of praising the ones that were there instantly and fixed the issue, they focus on negativity which leads me to believe they are all sockpuppets of the attacker/attackers and their profit gains they made from all this drama.
But I am also confused how it was so easy for the attacker to do it and how no one had hindsight of this being a possibility of happening. But that's maybe cause I am not a coder.

Something I do believe in is that this will in the end be positive news for the ethereum foundation. I read somewhere someone saying something along the lines of: ""the biggest difference between bitcoin and ethereum is that bitcoin never had the face, the creator, be there to talk about his creation and the people who mattered and who needed a face to trust for wider adoption."" This is what Ethereum has, and this creator saved the day yesterday but no one seems to realize that. It's starting to look like Ethereum is Gotham City and like them we have the hero that we need, but doen't deserve.

It does not necessarily need to mine 51% itself because there will be miners who won't care about or want the soft-fork patch.",1466262487
1642,ethereum,"I am not a lawyer, but I'm a law student and I'm thinking ""the attacker's"" legal argument is not as clear-cut as he/she claims. Can we start a smart contract to crowdsource funds to fight his claims in court?","If the attacker is trying to lawyer up, perhaps it's in DAO holders' best interests to lawyer up as well? 

From what I've followed in this area of law, the issue of whether exploiting a weakness in code is a criminal offense has been addressed in one federal case in Nevada, where a person exploited a weakness in a slot machine's code by entering a certain sequence of button pushes to receive an unwarranted pay out (see US v Kane, D Nev 2014). The DA ultimately dismissed charges of wire fraud and hacking, so the issue has never been actually ruled upon in court, and could conceivably go the other way.

There are also a number of civil issues that might apply in this case that I don't think have ever been ruled upon (ie interpreting a ""smart contract"", tortious conversion, a few others). 

(Assuming that open letter is legitimate), I'm thinking that if the attacker tries to use the courts to get his way like he's suggesting, they will have to identify themselves to file suit. I'm not sure what the requirements are for remaining anonymous as a plaintiff, but that seems like a stretch that the attacker would be in any more danger than any other plaintiff who files an unpopular suit (see: https://www.avvo.com/legal-answers/suing-as-a-john-doe-plaintiff-404766.html).

So once he/she does, we hand the matter to the police. This will freeze up any evidence involved and may create one form of repayment, and the possibility of which might force the ""attacker"" to the negotiating table while they are still anonymous.

They can also be named in a number of suits. The issue of whether code is all that applies in a real court or if clear intentions not explicitly mentioned has never been settled. A famous contracts case is Spaulding v. Morse, 322 Mass. 149, 76 N.E.2d 137 (Mass. 1947), where the court found that clear intention can be read into a contract where it is not expressly mentioned. There's never been any DAO conversation about how anyone *should* attack the DAO in the instant fashion, and lots about how splitting was installed as a mechanism for simply withdrawing your own investment, so there is a chance the attacker could be sued for breach or bad faith performance.

Again, I'm not a lawyer (nor a coder), so none of this should be considered professional opinion. But if we do want to play hardball with them, even if consensus is never reached in the matter of a fork, individual token holders may have plenty of legal action to take. Given that this may require an expensive suit and we want the best most expensive attorneys fighting in this gray area, using a smart contract to legitimately/inexpensively raise funds could bring credibility back to the process/ethereum/smart contracts. It may also force the attacker to negotiate for a bounty and keep their identity anonymous than risk legal action (or whatever else someone might have planned).

EDIT: MOST OF YOUR ARGUMENTS ARE INVALID, AS OUTLINED HERE BY CHRISOPH:

2 — The Hard Fork

 Move all funds from contracts with the code hash 7278d050619a624f84f51987149ddb439cdaadfba5966f7cfaea7ad44340a4ba to a new contract “RefundDAO” (we can loop through the proposal list in the main DAO to find all split DAOs)
replace the contract at the main DAO with a simple refund contract with only one function. This function takes one parameter (address of childDAO), to determine a combined balance of mainDAO and childDAO and then pays back ether accordingly (in order to also pay back DAO token holders who did already split)

With this solution, 100% of the funds can be refunded, because not a single wei has been going out of the DAOs yet. No rollback of blocks or transactions is required.

This is important: Usually when people think about hard forks, they imagine about rollbacks of entire blocks, undoing unrelated transactions (similar to bitcoin hard forks). But in this case,the hard fork is far more elegant and easier to implement, as there is no need to roll any blocks back, or to undo any transactions that have nothing to do with the DAO.

In fact, a typical ethereum user will not feel anything from that hardfork, besides a minor client update.""

1657,ethereum,My two ethers about the DAO hack and the hacker's open letter,"I just waked up and was shocked to read the DAO hacker's open letter: http://pastebin.com/CcGUBgDG

Here are my thoughts about this hack and the open letter:

1. Honestly the hacker is awesome, and this hack does warn the whole community to watch out the security of smart contract.

2. However, the open letter has logic fallacies. Whatever code and rules are written by DAO, it doesn't apply to Ethereum itself. Ethereum, as a platform (world computer) of all apps, definitely can step in if necessary. For example, if a company makes a biased rule and causes issues, the country can step in to judge it. Or if a contract has issue on execution, someone uses for his own profit, the law should judge the validity of the contract.

3. Based on my point 2, the DAO attacker can't sue the Ethereum community, even if the community agrees to delete the whole DAO contract.

4. There couple good points. Especially as one of my friend proposed: ""Code Is Law"". But this doesn't imply that the law can't be changed. Someone might mention ""contract spirit"" as well. Again, contract is based on its validity.

5. Bitcoin are frequently referred among this discussion. Firstly, Bitcoin is only a good reference for understanding the whole event, not a regulation to follow when Ethereum makes its decision. Secondly, based on my point 4, if code/law is not changeable, Bitcoin and Ethereum can't get updated from its very first release.

6. Even if we refer the history of Bitcoin, there was similar event that some wallet gets billions of BTCs. It was solved by hard fork.

7. Here is a metaphor: Ethereum as an application platform is like iOS's App Store. The App Store enables all apps to have in-app purchase with a virtual currency called Ether. The DAO is one of apps in App Store. The DAO sets up a bunch of rules, people rushed to buy Ether and invest into the DAO. Now a hacker uses the DAO's rule to take these Ethers. This makes users turn to the App Store for help and ask for refund. However, the hacker claims he follows the DAO's rules. At this moment, the Ethereum community can decide to do two things: a soft-fork to invalid the DAO and pause its execution; furthermore, a hard-fork to rollback all transactions on the DAO, and refund to users.

8. From the above metaphor, Ethereum is totally legal to make any decision. It all depends on whether there is a consensus for these decisions. Ethereum as a platform should consider its future. Right now, 16% of all Ethers in supply are threaten. When Ethereum switches from POW to POS, this 16% staker can do whatever he wants to, and might even bring Ethereum down. I personally support to solve this event by a soft-fork and a hard-fork if necessary. It is not because the DAO is too big to fail, but because Ethereum has a long way to go, and needs more time to change and grow.",1466264221

This is nonsense. 

First, there are hundreds of other great practical things the blockchain can do besides mathematical unmutable contracts. For example, that the contract must be collectively accepted, and this is HUGE, democracy as we never had it.

But more importantly, of course human decision and common sense must have the final word on contracts, and for several reasons :

1. The code has been designed by a few humans, hence it is not more intelligent than humans, it is as or less intelligent than those who programmed it. If ""features"" pop-up that even the programmers didn't predict, then it doesn't proove some mystical ""superiority"" of the code, but only human flaws merely coded, that must be corrected by human collective judgment. Why coding human flaws would make them right? 

2. When paper contracts are not fair, the court rules it. You know, jurisprudence. What's the difference? You think all court ruling declaring a contract unfair are wrong and evil?

3. Also, society evolves, and so will the codes.

4. If with neuronal networks or i dont-no-what the contracts get more intelligent than humans, then we will need a kill switch even more because, well, the singularity.

5. If the code is the only terms, how the hell will ordinary people understand what they are ""signing""? We dont want to be opressed by a code-o-cracy of all-mighty computer scientists XD

6. Imagine if ethereum is used to run a lot of inter-connected stuff on the web (wich is bound to happend), how the hell will people - and even professional coders - expertise in depth all the code before using a web ""function"" that happens to be a smart contract?

Ethereum will be a protocol used by ordinary people, and they will not need to learn how to code to use it, otherwise, it will never work. So all the ""code is law"" thing is just a computer scientist's fantasy.

1675,ethereum,"The pDAO, Partially Decentralized Autonomous Organization. A safer, faster, and more efficient DAO.","Right now, the DAO is completely decentralized (except for one very important part that we will address later)

All the funders work together to spend the money that they put in and invest. This is the same whether we are talking about The DAO or any of the others. 

In theory, this sounds great, right? Democracy! Crowd Wisdom! But in reality, things fall apart. Yesterday's hack was not the only issue The DAO had. Other problems were extreme **apathy**, **confusion**, and **pretentiousness** within the organization.

As you can see, none of the proposals ever met quorum or even came close. Why? Because of confusion. The majority of the token holders had no way of knowing how to vote, or even what they were supposed to vote for. There was no easy way of finding out either. And why was this? Pretentiousness. We had people in the Slack and the forums arguing with each other for no purpose other than to argue. I invite you to go into the Slack. It's full of arguments about semantics, faux-philosophy, and other useless things that won't help us. Any newcomer would immediately be overwhelmed and probably leave.  

Oh yeah, and I almost forgot. The DAO got ""hacked"" and Eth got stolen? Why? Because the Ethereum was **centralized**. All the Ethereum was kept in one address. That's like sticking $150 million into a safe somewhere, locking it, and hoping that no one comes to steal something.

So, how does the pDAO solve this? Here's how the pDAO works.  
There's actually several ways of accomplishing this, but here are the important parts. Several _trusted_ addresses are given 50% of the created pDAO tokens. This means that there must be a premine. The tokens could be given to company creators, a law firm, etc. The important thing is that no ONE address controls them all, or else they could be stolen. (It would actually be pretty good to give a large amount of that 50% to the company/contractor that created the DAO so they would have an incentive to work). The rest of the 50% is sold off as usual.

Now, what happens to the money once the sale ends? The 50% write proposals to move all the Ethereum out into cold storage. The Ethereum is held by people around the world who are trusted. (This should not be the company owners or employees.) It's also important that the Ethereum is not held by one person, because then, if they go rogue or lose it, it's all gone. At this point the 50% only use their tokens to vote when there is a security risk to the DAO.

Now that all the Ethereum is stored away, the proposal writing can begin. It would be slow and inefficient to consult the pDAO for every decision. So, the company _only_ needs to ask the pDAO for money when it's a larger sum of money then $1m dollars, or some other preset amount. This way, the company can still make decisions and function without the slowness of the pDAO, but the pDAO can still use crowd wisdom for large decisions. If the proposal is passed, then the holders of the Ethereum will give the necessary ETH to the company. (The holders of the 50% tokens should NOT vote on this.)

When it's dividend time, yay rewards!, a proposal is written to give out dividends, and Ethereum is put back into the pDAO and given out.

With this method, splits are not possible, but neither is a 51% attack.

I think it would be good that we all remember Ethereum being a crypto-currency is just means to an end.  
And that end is improving society.  
  
Am I in for the money, oh yes. But Ethereum is the first crypto currency I invested in, and the confidence came from the fact that the project has a real vision.  
  
-Cutting the middleman and rewarding people who create value  
-Making sure your funds are used for what you intended them to be used  
-Create a new kind of protection against malicious attacks  
-etc (I'm sure I'm forgetting a lot here)  
  
I honestly do not care that Ethereum is a crypto-currency. The project could have taken another form, I would still have invested if it had the same positive disrupting potential on society, because at the end of the day that is what drives adoption.  
I also liked the community , a lot of positive thinking.   
  
Now back to the hard fork debate, the question is:  
At this point in time, would it be more damaging in the long term for Ethereum to compromise on its technicality or on its vision?  
   
If Ethereum is the blockchain that is going to change the world, people will only adopt it if they believe it will change for the (or their) world for the best.    
I know I would never have invested in something where 15% of the community was robbed millions of dollars and the other 85% did not seize the opportunity to get the fund and give them back to their owners.  
  
I understand smart contracts are meant to be immutable but at the end of the day they are only a tool to facilitate and improve human interaction.  
You know the proverb: ""when you only have a hammer, everything looks like a nail"". Well don't forget what is being attempted to build with that hammer.  
  
  
I hope there is a way for The DAO to get a refund without a hard fork, but if that's the only way, I think it should be done.  
The image of a community that let this shit happen is way more damaging than any hard fork.  
  
If we all accept to go through this as a community, we will be much, much stronger.
  
Also don't forget that The DAO, as naive as it can seem now was a big step forward in terms of community, it generated A LOT of interesting discussions and the majority of the holders were interested in funding project that would help the Ethereum ecosystem grow event if that meant no direct revenue to The DAO.  
  
One last point: a promise of Ethereum is to enable unstoppable application.  
Does The DAO as it stands qualify for an unstoppable application, I don't think so.  
The DAO was never intended to leak Ether and it as in fact has been stopped.  
Considering the immutable nature of smart contracts, this is going to be an ongoing problem: intent VS actual behavior.  And nobody in his right mind can tell me that Software can be produced without bugs.  
So maybe it's time to step back and look at the Ethereum platform as a whole and see how we can improve it to facilitate creating applications that are indeed unstoppable.
  
Disclosure:  
I own DAO tokens. Would I be for a hard fork if I held only Ether? I think I would.

1683,ethereum,The existential threat of left versus right Ethereans,"This DAO debacle has brought to light the implicit ideological composition of this community. I will characterize this composition broadly in terms of a left and right wing divide.

From what I can gather, right wing Ethereans emphasize a radical libertarianism committed to an unwavering sense of self-ownership and individualism. The self clearly takes precedence over the community. Property clearly takes precedence over the public good.

The right wing is like the father. Disciplined, enterprising, and merciless. They value personal responsibility regardless of the consequences. It's quite irrelevant to them that people have been harmed when they perceive that harm to have been a result of their own actions. And thus, if code is law then the code is absolute. And if other people are ""too stupid"" or ""weak"" to make the correct choices with respect to the code, then they should suffer what they must. That is their mentality. That is the logic of the right.

In contrast, Ethereans on the left gravitate more towards a communitarian or cosmopolitan form of anarchism. The community, society, or the world at large is what takes precedence over and above the individual. They view the public good as being more righteous than self-interest. The left is like the mother. Supportive, understanding, and compassionate. They recognize personal vulnerability and value fairness regardless of the consequences. They see themselves promoting the humanitarian interest. It is completely relevant to them whether or not people are harmed in a way that they perceive to be unjust. And thus, if code is law then the law is absolute. Nobody is too ""stupid"" or ""weak"" to be allowed to suffer for no good reason. For them, everyone is limited. Everyone is subject to making mistakes. Everyone is dependent on each other. That is their mentality. That is the logic of the left.

Both the right and the left are idealistic. Neither one is no more ""pragmatic"" than the other. Both are striving for their ideals.

We are seeing this dynamic play itself out with respect to the DAO, just like we've seen it played out in modern politics. Once more, people cannot set aside their differences or work towards a mutual solution. Neither side is willing to comprise because both sides are convinced of their own ideals. If history is any indicator, the right will seek to demoralize or conquer the left. And the left will try to enlist popular support for a just cause. Neither side will actually succeed to convince the other. Supposedly, it'll be left up to chance whether or not the miners are predominately on the left or the right of this ideological spectrum.

That said, I think it's fair to speculate there are more stakeholders with influence on the right than there are on the left at this point in time. That is, supposing a large enough overlap exists between the sentiments of crypto-enthusiasts and the Ethereum mining community. It's highly probable, to my mind, that the typical miner is a young middle / upper-middle class Western-European male and early Bitcoin adopter. What I've come to understand about this group, especially over the past days, is that they have emerged into a libertarian super-majority element in the Ethereum community. I don't think reddit is an absolute measure of this phenomenon, but it makes sense. The cryptosphere is fairly unique politically and with little new blood actually coming in from what I can tell. If this is the demographic in control, it stands to reason they will remain strongly antagonistic to the interests of the left. I sincerely doubt Vitalik's symbolic authority carries very much weight with them. Clearly, this group cannot be so easily persuaded.

We know the right is largely satisfied with doing nothing. The extent of their cooperation rests strictly on the soft fork. Perhaps because it satisfies their sense of punishment or because it will increase the value of their personal holdings. Self-interest will dictate that they insulate themselves from any costs incurred by supporting the victims. Likewise, personal responsibility may also dictate that the thief acted maliciously and should be disciplined. The investors on the other hand can never be saved. They failed and should accept their losses. That's likely to be the majority decision. There will, of course, be purists who will argue for the attacker. But to appease the left even they can probably be motivated to make a concession. The right probably already has a good sense of their power in the community. They feel confident that they can prevent a hard fork. Their mood is one of arrogance.

The left is most clearly in favor of the soft AND hard fork. Making the victims of the DAO whole, restoring confidence, and helping the Ethereum ecosystem to flourish is their main objective. They could care less if the code is technically immutable or if people are technically at fault for making a bad investment. They could care less if this seems like a superfluous use of power. For them, this is the right thing to do. Rejecting the forks will create a powerful disincentive for them to help this community in the future. They are disillusioned with the project and may move to other things that will respect their ideals. Their mood is one of anxiety.

What I hope this thinking reveals, if you accept the premises, is that this conflict is having a distinct effect on the identity of the Ethereum community. But more than that, it's revealing what I would perceive as a highly destructive imbalance of power. What do I mean by that? I mean the Ethereum community is not uniformly distributed. It's a distorted reflection of people's actual beliefs and values. Those who have come into Ethereum from the left are the super-minority. Similarly, the general public is not included in this decision. What we have is a non-representative front-loading of political power. A fractional minority of the actual population is deciding the fate of an ecosystem that will potentially affect millions of people. Realize this is not merely about the Ethereum community itself. This is about who has a legitimate right to control the ultimate effects of a public infrastructure.

If this were conventional politics, we'd have a strong opposition party to the right. But that's not what we have here. What we have is this individualist super-majority vs. communitarian super-minority polarization, and a vast unaccounted population that will never have the opportunity to make a decision at this moment. Why is that relevant? Because what we do here will determine people perceive Ethereum and its community for years to come. We will either become the callous crypto-geeks that allowed this incalculable criminal act to take place, or we're the moral center of a decentralized governance system. I have no other reading of the current situation. Something of enormous circumstance is being decided without a proper accounting of public interests. The left is that accounting.

If this is correct, Ethereum seems destined to be dragged into a similar political composition as Bitcoin. More and more from the left will be repelled by the right's ethical lapses in judgment, just like they were repelled from Bitcoin. We will have one and the same group continuing to dominate the cryptocurrency space. The technology will have improved, but the community will have stagnated. This in itself will demolish any realistic plans for mass adoption in the near to mid-term future and undermine investor confidence. It will turn off many of us because the operators of the network will be seen as falling out of alignment with the public good. And Ethereum will be nothing more than a cool project that was way ahead of its time, forever tainted by the self-righteous insiders who couldn't see the larger picture. And that'll be that. The left will pivot and move its support to the next promising innovation.

That's my bleak and speculative take on what's happening right now. I don't trust this community any longer. I trusted the Ethereum foundation and its early community. I trusted the developers. But the community at this moment is quite sick. I say that in the most compassionate and non-judgmental sense possible given the circumstances. What we're seeing right now is a beautiful world-changing project potentially burning to the ground. We're seeing it turn into something it was never meant to be.

Forking from Bitcoin had a purpose. It was a statement not merely about technology but an opportunity to express a different set of human values. I can only speak for myself, but I never shared the values of Bitcoinners. I am diametrically opposed to them. If the dynamics of this community are such that you insist to carry your weight into Ethereum and transform it into Bitcoin 2.0, then what can we do? You have the power to do that. That's your abusive right. I will quietly exercise my right and exit. I expect I won't be alone in that sentiment. And I can only hope, the developers themselves will have the foresight to be among us.",1466267083

1687,ethereum,"""No hard fork"" does NOT mean ""DAO holders lose all their ETH"". This debate is being rushed - let's examine ALL options.","Starting with two fact checks:

""No hard fork means the thief gets the money"". I have not seen a single pro-hard-fork advocate suggest we should not block the thief's transactions with a soft fork. This is pure FUD to discredit this position.

""No hard fork means DAO holders get nothing"". From what I understand, **70%** of the ether from the DAO is recoverable with only soft forks (only permit slock to attack the DAO, for example) (TODO check exact number). **This is just from theDAO contract itself. (Mining pools: Get the soft fork online now).** I believe the difference can be made up without changing protocol rules (ideas at the end of the post)

And an appeal to our favorite authority, since that's suddenly popular in this subreddit:

&gt; from vbuterin via /r/ethereum sent 1 day ago
&gt; &gt; Don't get confused, people (that I've talked to) are only arguing against the followup hardfork.
&gt;
&gt; Got it (I'll cc /u/Rune4444 as he's concerned too). Some in the dev community actually think that it may be possible to recover *most or all the funds in the dao without the subsequent state-changing hardfork*, using only miner collusion - essentially, it would be something like using the stalker attack against this attacker. *I'd be perfectly fine with this approach if it proves feasible and is what the community wants.*


Here are the definitions as I understand them in the context of this issue: a *soft fork* is one which could later be removed, and it's as if it never existed. Miners (/stakers) basically censor select transactions temporarily. For example, ""any transaction which runs code from address X cannot be included in a block"". *Soft forks are legitimate because miner (/staker) censorship is within Ethereum's threat model.* A *hard fork* is one which permanently changes the protocol rules. An example is ""An address is defined as a hash of the code plus nonce etc, except for special address Y, which has special code Z"". It requires an update to the yellow paper and formal specification.


The basic argument against doing a hard fork without exhausting other options is 1) Everyone has *some* percentage at which they would agree that a loss due to a application-level bug which is brutally enforced by protocol is a *positive* proof of concept of Ethereum, not a crisis situation, and 2) if the effective ETH loss that DAO holders suffered can be made less than that amount within the protocol, a hard fork is not worth it.

There are several concrete bounds on 1) which come from the Foundation's past actions and statements. We can be extremely confident they would not be promoting a protocol change if less money was lost than they've refused to do a hard fork for before, for example. I don't see any arguments that the minimum acceptable refund to justify a not-fork is something less than 100%.

Personally I am against a hard fork UNTIL all options are fairly debated. I mainly only have one goal, which is to make a stablecoin that is at least pretty good. This issue became relevant because to achieve that goal using ethereum I need ethereum to work as advertised and not allow any protocol devs to be pressured into rewriting balances in high stakes situations.


Anyway, initial ideas for making up the last 30%:

* Charity commitment scheme. An optional kickstarter-like tax on ourselves for those willing to lose some ETH to avoid hard forks. I think you might be surprised how much this is worth to some people.
* Force attacker's hand: ""Ransom"" contract + soft fork to give choice of 0 ETH or pay out and get 100 ETH.
* Whatever the stalker attack V described is
* Use some of the discretionary 26% inflation during POS: This was outlined within the original Ethereum terms, I don't see how people think this is more consensus-breaking than literally changing the formal protocol.",1466267450

1699,ethereum,Smart contracts without the loss of ETH ownership. Can it be done?,"Hi!

Disclaimer: I know nothing about implementation details of Ethereum and the EVM!

I was thinking a bit about the contracts, and if we could somehow make them immunute to stuff like this.

In bitcoin world, there is a saying ""If you don't own the keys, you don't own the bitcoins"". Well, the same should be true for ETH, right?

So if we want to enter contract, we should have a way to have they keys until the funds are used. Here is a sketch what I envision in case of a DAO.

1) You create wallet contract. Only you have the keys, but this separates Ether for the contract from your other funds. The DAO knows about them, but doesn't have to necessarily maintain tokens for them.
2) If you want to vote, you publish a pre-signed transaction anyone can include in the chain given some conditions are met (depending on the voting system). This might be in form ""I submit X Ether if we vote Yes"", and call a function of the DAO, giving this as a parameter. Now once the vote is complete, somone (proposal author?) might take all of these now-valid pre-signed transactions and put them on the net.
3) If you decide to withdraw, you just empty your wallet contract and your voting and other privileges are void.
4) You might maintain reward tokens and other stuff as it has been done.

Now, this has some drawbacks. I can see no easy way to force someone to move funds if the majority decides to do so, and thus obviously isn't equivalent to what TheDAO was, but seems pretty good.

Some changes might be required to the EVM, possibly the protocol, but hey, if it makes the future safer and easier to code?

Tell me what you think, including that it's a stupid idea (but say why), possibly someone already though of it and I didn't notice?

Thanks!",1466268389

1712,ethereum,"Smart Contracts and Ethics : If someone signs a contract to be enslaved, should a third party intervene?","To all those that will be deciding whether or not to do a hard fork or a soft fork, I'd like for you all to think of the ethical ramifications of that decision, especially with all the capabilities and possibilities that Ethereum introduces.

The smart contracts themselves are written law (or that's the way we can think of them) since they can independently enforce themselves, are agreed upon by all parties, and the terms and conditions can only be understood one way (not subjective). However, what if the law itself, was ""wrong"" or unethical (a subjective issue)?

I see that some among the group that is arguing against the fork, are arguing that a contract is perfect, and must be enforced 100% to keep the integrity of the system, and this belief that everyones contracts will be enforced as it is written, is what gives confidence and credibility to the platform itself. If an individual chooses to engage in that contract, they have made the conscious decision to agree to all of that contracts terms and conditions. The Ethereum platform itself, must not intervene in this agreement, only facilitate in the enforcement of the contracts within it.

However, what if there is a person who has signed a contract to be enslaved to another individual or even an organization?  Should the platform intervene? Should it still intervene if the language within it states that the individual to be enslaved is someone whose signature is not even required in the contract?  A contract that requires someone to hurt someone else?  If one can agree that an intervention should occur in some cases, where does it begin, and where does it end?

A contract is created in which both parties accidently agree to delete all of their holdings, should Eth intervene? A predatory lender loans someone money at an interest rate of 3000% a year, should Eth intervene? A contract is written in which someone sells their body, should Eth intervene? What if they were selling someone elses body, should Eth intervene then? Where is the line that we draw in which our countries laws must be followed on the platform? If we do follow our countries laws, whose jurisdiction do we follow when a contract is made by international parties? What do we do about international commerce laws?

Ethereum has introduced an interesting new concept in law, terms and conditions that are not subjective, that will always be enforced if the conditions are met.  When you are making the decision to do a hard, soft, or no fork, please think about these things.

When it comes to our current problem, the question is this : If this is a glitch in the system, and not a contract that all parties wanted, should this be reversed? Like a bank that secures your money for a large fee, and unknowingly, their backdoor is left open all night, should you both agree to reverse the contract if it will return the funds? If this ""glitch"" is just a clause that an unscrupulous lender had purposefully placed in the system, and people blindly signed it, should this be reversed?

In the end, when making this decision, you are deciding the future of Ethereum.

Should it be a platform free of intervention? Whose terms and conditions are ""perfect"", something never before seen in our world when it comes to objectivity with no biases. A just mediator if you will, who has no critiques or quams about the ethics within the contract, only that the contract is enforced if both parties agree to it.

Should the platform allow intervention when it comes to fundamental human rights? Rights of Life, Liberty, and Property/POH? Should it go even deeper then that and enforce all the laws within ones country?

If we want Ethereum to grow and be utilized by the masses, I highly recommend that there are safeguards in place to protect the individuals within it. If we want it to remain a niche system, one in which the words within it are law, then the number of adopters will be limited to those with the capabilties and the reasons to utilize it.

Final thoughts: Why not both? Certain DAO's will have certain oversights and protections. One can be for mass consumer adoption, and another can be a wild west of sorts for any and all contracts (whose to say this can even be stopped, or if a duplicate platform doesn't just handle this niche?)

Whatever you decide, understand that this decision is made by the community itself, something that is as complex as the ethics of smart contracts itself.",1466271151

The fact there will be a new code implementing a hard/soft fork does not stop you or anybody else in fact to continue to use previous versions of the code, right? Core Ethereum developers are just providing to all the option to choose. Anybody else could have created a new branch of the code with whatever fork they want on it and all could equally decide to use it or not.

In reference to miners and exchanges, same as you all, they can decide to follow or not a fork, in fact they can support both if you like. If the exchange you use does not follow the option you want just move to another exchange, or create your own if none support your decision. Equally, if all miners move away from the branch you want to support just create your own mining operation to support the network.

I only see the problem if the majority choses the option you do not support but you still want to continue to benefit from the network (transactions validations, exchanges, creation of value) with no additional efforts from your side.

The blockchain value is created by its users, and it is just fair all have the option to ""vote"". Otherwise, it would just be those who want to maintain current status imposing on the rest.

This post is not to recommend or publicly support any of the two options, I just want to express it is just fair from my point of view that all users, who actually create the network value, have the option to decide, and this can only be done for good by providing a coded fork.

1715,ethereum,Why not both? Hardfork,"Why not just divide Ethereum into two chains. One Hardforked one, in which the DAO people will get their (reduced) refund and one that is not hardforked, in which the attacker keeps his ETH.

Exchanges and miners can choose to support one chain, or both. Poloniex for example could have ETH1 and ETH2 to trade. Miners could mine ETH1 with one of their rigs and ETH2 with their other rigs, or switch daily, or just pick their favorite. Ethereum foundation is free to choose which one they support too, or they might even keep supporting both, releasing separate wallets for them too.

After a month or more we will see what the community chooses, the majority will probably choose one of the chains and the other will slowly be forgotten or lose value. This way the whole community chooses the chain and not just the miners and not just Vitalik or some other centralized group.

To me this seems the fairest way. The attacker can access his ETH. The DAO holders can access their ETH and miners are free to support what they want. Obviously a lot of extra volatility will happen with Ether and the price will probably go down for a while, but in the end a lot of new people can join in cheaply, which makes Ethereum even more decentralized.",1466271466

Specifically, I would recommend using ""functional"" (rather than ""procedural"") languages for mission-critical code which will be driving ""smart contracts"" - and even better if a high-level ""specification"" language could be used, allowing formal derivation of a (verifiably correct) program in a low-level ""implementation"" language (ie, providing mathematical proof that the implementation satisfies the specification - and mitigating the problem where the high-level human-readable ""description"" is *different* from the low-level machine-runnable ""code""). I suspect many people (raised in a world where JavaScript is the ""assembly language of the web"") might not know about some of the history and possibly related work. So take this as a stern lecture telling you to take a good look at the history of functional languages (and specification vs implementation languages) as used in mission-critical projects, including finance - which, even when *using* such tools, are still very hard to get right - as we can see from the decades-long history of failures of major projects in defense, healthcare, aerospace, etc.

Below is the OP original posted on r/btc:

The world already has enough crappy buggy websites based on a mish-mash of error-prone procedural JavaScript - a low-level, procedural language which is notorious for its lack of formal semantics and verification.

JavaScript is such a mess that almost *no webdesigners* directly program in it any more - they work in one of the many higher-level ""JavaScript frameworks"", and/or use a higher-level language which ""compiles to"" JavaScript.

The mere fact that there are so *many* of these higher-level alternatives simply proves that a low-level language like JavaScript is *not useful on its own:*

https://duckduckgo.com/?t=disconnect&amp;x=%2Fhtml&amp;q=languages+that+compile+to+javascript&amp;ia=web

https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS

JavaScript is the ""assembly language"" of the web:

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=javascript+assembly+language+web&amp;t=disconnect&amp;ia=web

Every day, you visit websites (on your computer, on your smartphone) where some JavaScript error occurs. The page is displayed incorrectly, and you go on with your life.

There is a reason why crappy error-prone procedural low-level languages like JavaScript aren't used to power nuclear reactors, or missile systems, or X-ray machines - or financial applications.

**Programs produced by these crappy low-level procedural languages routinely have bugs.**

These languages are *only* used for unimportant things like consumer-facing websites. 

(And most of those pages were *not* even written directly in JavaScript - they used one of those higher-level frameworks / languages in the first links above. But still - the website generated errors.)

**What do the Big Boys use?**

The US Department of Defense doesn't program missile systems in low-level procedural languages like JavaScript - they use languages like ADA and Spark (and higher-level *specification* languages like ANNA) - where *the language design itself* guarantees that things like some ridiculous ""recursive call bug"" simply *cannot happen* - and where the use of a *specification* language forces the programmer to spell out in advance *what* the program is supposed to do, before digging down into the implementation details of *how* it's supposed to do it.

And your boring old bank uses declarative workhorses like SQL - where most of the work can be done without even running any procedural code - avoiding the very notion of ""recursion"" in the first place. 

Now, some Ethereum devs put together an investment fund controlling a quarter of a billion dollars - using a language which looks and feels (and runs) a helluva lot like JavaScript: Ethereum's Solidity.

And the whole thing blew up in their face - because the language design of Ethereum's Solidity was total wrong.

Contractual law / human society should *not* run by these kinds of crappy bug-prone low-level procedural languages.

**The Big Boys derive provably correct implementations from very-high-level specifications**

Note that ""The DAO"" had two different ""descriptions"":

- An non-binding, high-level, more human-readable one (in ancillary materials, posted separately)

- A binding, low-level, less human-readable one (the actual code)

This is ok for unimportant projects.

But for important projects, the ""high-level, more human-readable"" version is actually written in a formal *specification language* which supports things like automatically deriving the *implementation* from it (and mathematicaly proving that the implementation is correct - ie, that is satisfies the specification).

So, when using a formal specification language coupled with an implementation language, the two verions of the system are ""linked"" - ie, the implementation is *mechanistically derived* from the specification, and formal tools for derivation and validation can be used to *mathematically prove* that the (less human-readable) implementation *has the exact same semantics* as the (more human-readable) specification.

**How many cryptocurrency scripting kiddies actually know this stuff?**

Lots of this stuff is probably foreign to all these scripting kiddies and web designers whose concept of ""programming"" up till now has basically been ""Hey let's slap some JavaScript onto a web page!""

I can assure you - there are many, many programmers who would never touch that world with a ten-foot pole. 

They work for the Department of Defense, they work on Wall Street (on *back-office* systems - handling billions of dollars), they develop software running nuclear reactors or MRI machines - or they do research and development at academic institutions. 

For many of these people (in the academic world), even a supposedly ""well-defined"" and ""battle-tested"" language like C/C++ is totally ""beneath"" them. 

I have heard theoretical computer scientists, working on DARPA-funded *language design* projects, say that they wanted to avoid using C/C++ as an implementation language **""because it lacks a clearly defined semantics.""** (These are academics who use things like functional languages, algebraic languages, etc. - which are often more ""declarative"" in nature, versus the ""procedural"" languages many casual programmers use).

There is a whole world of programming where not only ""GOTO"" is ridiculed - but even commonly used procedural constructs ""for-loops"" and ""try/throw/catch"" blocks for exceptions are *also* avoided.

**Get serious or GTFO**

The only acceptable, serious approach for doing stuff like ""smart contracts"" or the ""The DAO"" *must* be based on much more serious languages than this silly ""Solidity"" invented by some kid - eg, if we're going to start migrating contractual law onto machines, then the *only* languages we should be using must:

- be ""functional"" (eg, from the family of Haskell/ML) - *not* procedural languages (eg, C/C++, Java, JavaScript, etc.)

- support high-level, formal tools for program specification, derivation, and validation 

As far as I'm concerned, if we want machines to run our contractual law and financial structures, then the minimal acceptable approach must be:

- *implementing* in a *functional* language like Ocaml (used with great success by Jane Street, a Wall Street firm - check out their videos on YouTube) 

- and long-term, we should think about *specifying* using a language like Coq (a theorem prover which can be used to derive machine-runnable Ocaml programs/implementations from human-readable specifications).

**Kids think the glass is half-full. Pros know it's half-empty.**

Maybe all this sounds totally foreign and complicated to today's ""scripting kiddies"" - the kinds of people like Mark Karepelès who thought he could process hundreds of millions of dollars using that ""fractal of bad design"" known as PHP - and now Vitalik - who seems like a smart kid, but still, I wonder:

- how much he's studied up on things like functional languages, or 

- if he's even heard of the Curry-Howard Isomophism, and understands how it can be applied to the problem of developing human-readable *specifications* (analogous to theorems), and deriving *provably correct* machine-runnable *implementations/programs* (analogous to proofs) from them

- if he's heard of stuff like NATO's 1968 conference on the ""software crisis"" - which many believe is still not resolved

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=nato+1968+software+crisis&amp;ia=web

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=AI+winter&amp;t=disconnect&amp;ia=about

The above all reflect the fact that *computer programming as practiced by most people in the industry today is actually a total fucking disaster*. 

""Lethal software"" is a thing. 

http://embeddedgurus.com/barr-code/2014/03/lethal-software-defects-patriot-missile-failure/

""Waterfall"" and ""agile"" and ""Xtreme"" and countless other software development and management methodologies have been proposed, out of desperation, to deal with the fact that many programming projects, using popular ""procedural"" languages, *fail*. 

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=waterfall+agile+xtreme&amp;t=disconnect&amp;ia=web

These methodologies do all work ""more-or-less"" - but note that they all rely heavily on stuff outside the code (mostly meetings, pep talks, quality assurance testing, etc.) - and they have been proposed out of a dire necessity - the fact that ""the code itself"" normally does *not* work right, without continual human prodding from managerial types.

We almost *never* trust ""the code itself"" to work properly. Because after a few decades of experience (using these crappy languages), we know that it *almost never does.*

**Software development is a mess**

The take-away is: software development is a *mess* - even when it's done by Wall Street or NASA or the Department of Defense, incorporating ""functional"" languages, or ""formal methods"" supporting an initial ""specification"" followed by a derived (and supposedly ""provably correct"") ""implementation"".

So... the lesson is... a newly-invented language like Solidity... which people thought was ""cool"" because it ""looked like"" JavaScript  - is nowhere near the kind of rigorous, absolutely safe level required for handling a quarter of a billion dollars in people's actual wealth.

Vitalik seems like a great guy - but this whole area of ""smart conctracts"" and ""distributed automous organizations"" will have to attract many more serious heavyweights from industry and academia before it will be safe enough to run contractual law and financial structures controlling hundreds of millions of dollars in people's actual money and affecting people's actual lives.

**Some random links**

To give one tiny example (and I'm not saying that Ethereum or ""The DAO"" necessary has to *use* this sort of thing - I'm just curious as to what people's backgrounds might be) - does anyone involved with Ethereum or ""The DAO"" have a passing acquaintance (perhaps from years ago), with historical, related work like the following:

Just because you're storing stuff in a permissionless blockchain, does *not* mean you get to ignore all this historical, possibly related work.

In particular, you can go ahead and design a ""smart contracts"" language to run on your decentralized permissionless blockchain. But if your goal is that it should ""look like JavaScript"" (instead of ""acting like Haskell or Ocaml"") - then you're probably doing it wrong.

**It's about language design**

On a final note - it's not about ""recursion"" or ""complexity"" or even ""avoiding Turing-completeness"". Someday, we should be able to have all those things in our smart contracts and DAOs.

What it's really about is *language design* - including domain-specific languages (DSLs), ideally within a development ecosystem which includes both a high-level *specification* language, as well as a low-level (machine-runnable) *implementation* language - where a provably correct program/implementation is mechanistically *derived* from its specification. 

(And by the way, this would have given us a high-level, formal, human-readable, and legally enforceable *specification of ""The DAO"" - instead of the informal, meaningless, irrelevant English-language ""description"" which so many suckers fell for - and which the hacker was able to totally ignore and override, when he took the time to read the only ""spec"" there was: the ""implementation"", which was in code whose semantics were obvious to almost nobody.)

Language design, formal methods, program derivation and verification, model theory - these are entire fields within theoretical computer science. Is there anyone involved in ""smart contracts"" and DAOs who knows about this kind of stuff? If so, I think the community would love to hear what they're doing. 

**Sorry to be ""that guy"" - but someone has to say it:**

Smart contracts and DAOs are going to be a disaster - and cause yet more human suffering in this capitalist system - if we base them on JavaScript-like languages - instead of on state-of-the-art industrial-strength functional languages like Ocaml and Haskell and formally verifiable specification languages like Coq.

3.  Start attracting new money, artificially inflate the coin with collected BTC.

4. Wait for FOMO and panic buying to begin. Continue spreading hype. Shills are welcome.

5. Start slowly dumping pre-mined stash once media coverage begins. Besides, the creators got the coins for nothing so an price above zero is a good price.

6. Once the pump starts to lose steam and sellers overtake buyers, pull the rug out from underneath by orchestrating a fake ""hack"". Creators simply transfer a premined stash to a new address and announce the ""hack"".

7. Start dumping with what's left of the bag and now that everyone is trapped and their BTC is safely in the creators pocket its all downhill from here.

Whether or not a hard fork should be implemented to actually return stolen Ether to investors is not an immediate issue we need to be concerned with.

1746,ethereum,Admit That Smart Contracts cannot be relied on in their infancy and need safe-guards and best practices in place for both the User of the platform and the Creators of the platform,"I think that there is only one course of action to make when it comes to Ethereum and PR. 

Ethereum needs to admit that relying on Smart Contracts as law is 100% flawed especially in its infancy, and especially on a platform that is not even complete. They need work to correct and remedy those mistakes both for their users of the platform now and the users of their platform in the future. How are you going to advertise that the platform can be used by all people, even those new to the technological world and those who are not coders, and then screw them over because Smart Contracts require...what's that, some form of--trust and accountability between parties (not the trustless'ness that has been spouted).

Ethereum should admit their mistakes openly when it comes to Immutable Smart Contracts and the flaws and cons of that as exemplified in the DAO. They then need to work hard to not only correct and prevent these bad Smart Contracts from hurting good people, but to build better and set safe-guards in place to protect their users of the platform who have made the decision to show their support and loyalty by adopting that technology.

We need to acknowledge that unless we are naive, that in this world there is no such thing as 'trustless' even machines are made by people (backdoors are being built in software everyday)... some type of safe-guard must be in place to stop these bad actors from hurting the good actors. Even relying on Smart Contract (especially for non-techie, non-coders) requires some form of 'trust' or system in place towards the human who wrote the code. I mean what happened with the DAO could easily have been a bug written into the smart contract by the original founder to be able to gain control and exploit their own system in case it did not go their way. What is to protect users against those backdoors?

Especially those who don't know how to read code, who are trusting the English wording of a Smart Contract would just be screwed, and the Ethereum platform would not be open or willing to protect their users because the users made the decision to sign up and it is their fault.To say  Smart Contracts are law for better or worse, there is nothing wrong with them, it's the users who created them and the others who joined them who are at fault, no one but them are responsible. They 'chose' to use the product. So let them, who believed in our vision, burn.

Is that the way to gain trust?

In the future what is to protect the users against these type of attacks? Who and how is a person to be held accountable? This is something that requires if not trust between people, than trust in a decentralized system of smart contracts that quite frankly the DAO has proven is not something that can be trusted. This isn't just a problem with the DAO but with the Ethereum's whole selling point itself. 

The DAO was a great example of Ethereum and everything it stood for, they themselves promoted and backed it to prove how great Smart contracts were and yet did not due their own due diligence before promoting it. And now instead of protecting it's users as a community Ethereum wishes to punish them for using a Smart Contract that hurt the users who adopted it in full faith of Ethereum's vision, that Smart Contracts could be law and that no trust was needed. 

Admitting that there are bad actors, that trust is required, and that safe-guards are needed to protect, NOT BURN, the users and early adopters especially in the beginning is the first step.

Smart contracts require trust between anonymous parties or a system of arbitration or a better system to work against these bad actors, audibility and accountability needs to be built into the system. Yes the system works as designed, but that system is flawed and has the potential to hurt thousands if safe-guards aren't put in place, just as easily as it has the potential to help when those safe-guards are put in place.

To be able to trust a smart contract requires the ability to trust that if a bad actor is involved at any level someone is held accountable for exploiting it with a system in place to protect. I hear people saying that to hard fork would 'prove' that smart contracts are flawed, well good, prove it, and protect your users from the abuse of that flaw.

Another problem with Smart Contracts is that it also requires that people who participate and use the code must actually know how to read code in order to be involved, to make sure the code does as it says, and to protect users when the code does not do as the English translation states it should do.

In essence it is better to admit that you were wrong, that Smart contracts in their infancy require safe-guards, are not for everyone and that best practices need to be learned for both the users who use them and the people who make them, as well as a way to protect the good actors from the bad, and instead of trying to sell users on all the things that's great about them, admit all the things that are wrong about them too and help inform them on how to make better decisions surrounding smart contracts. Let the DAO 1.0 forever be an example of that, no matter how it turns out.

Yes Smart Contracts have their pros, but if a code is buggy from the start, and requires non-coders to know how to read and vet code, then it's not user-friendly and as such users and businesses should not adopt the technology at least not without taking these safe-guards into account from the 'inside', or else the DAO could be any fully decentralized autonomous platform or app. Trustlessness cannot exist with Smart Contracts in it's infancy at least not until a better system is put in place and implemented, and to say otherwise is negligence.

It's a bitter pill to swallow. But admitting the mistakes and flaws in the system is the first step required to safe-guard and build better upon an idea that could work if that is taken into consideration.

But religiously standing behind Smart Contracts as Law even when it hurts the users isn't the way you're going to get people to adopt this platform are the products it creates.

Ethereum has a responsibility to safe-guard and protect it's users from bad actors,  to create criteria for building better smarter Contract.

Unlike certain people we won't be taking money from the crowd before we have figured out the legality around these things.  Patience is a virtue.  Our hope for this company is that we will bring more sovereignty and strength to the network which is a plus for everyone involved.  Weifund should be rolling out their beta sometime in July and we are looking forward to connecting to it and getting everything set for our next SEC meeting.

June 8th was a VERY important day.  There are a few things that happened on this day to set the wheels in motion for this heist.  I am in no way saying any individual is guilty, but when there is a pile of evidence all pointing to the same thing, one has to wonder.

What happened on June 8th?  A few things.  Strap yourself in, its about to get dirty.

We can all agree this all happening within a few hours of each other is very coincidental....but wait....

* June 12th the price of ETH goes from $14USD to $21USD over the next few days and peaks just before the heist happens. Hmm.

* June 17th TheDAO starts getting drained.  The distraction has begun.

Obviously none of this is concrete evidence that this was coordinated.  But generally when you start to see weird shit happen all at the same time, then something major comes after, some questions need to be raised.

If I was LISK and I wanted to damage my biggest competitor in my infancy... I would probably coordinate some kind of attack that will A. destroy my competitors most valuable project, and B. Devalue my competitor and cause uncertainty while dividing the user base (divide and conquer via fork debate).

The attacker(s) **KNEW** they wouldn't see a single ETH coin from the heist.

So where is the motivation...  To be cool and cause reddit to go in a uproar?  Always fun, but nah. Greed is much stronger than a need for anonymous ego inflation.  The real motivation is profiting off a competing technology, imho.

How can I be so sure?  I cannot.  But I have studied this world enough to know when something isn't right, and greed is one hell of a motivator throughout history.  Do you really think for a second the attacker(s) thought they would get away with millions of ETH and cash them out somewhere?  Not a chance, they are obviously smart enough to pull this off, then they are smart enough to know they would have never cashed out the stolen ETH.

So why do it?  Simple, watch me wave my hand while my other hand picks your pocket.  You are currently in one of the biggest cryptocurrency scandals of all time.

Now you may be also worried that he dumps his ethers all at once provoking a dramatic drop in price. Game theory tells us it is unlikely that he does this. First of all, it would be easily traceable. Secondly, he also wants the value of ether to remain high. He will likely sell his ethers slowly.

From what I understand so far a hardfork will not roll back any transactions not related to the DAO so I honestly don't see any problem with the majority agreeing to do so, except for philosophical debates about the ethereum foundation having power and how the system were supposed to be ""trustless"" without a ""police"" like figure.

Now yes the system is supposed to be, but this is really an exceptional circumstance where not only 14% of all ethers will be lost but also all those people who put money in DAO will lose at least some money... provided the attacker doesn't do the attack again. If the attack happens again and it drains out all ethers, then all ethers is lost for all DAO investors. Is it fair for all those investors to lose money(of any amount) because a bug in DAO AND because the ethereum community is full of unmerciful people? 

If you're just going to go with a ""no a hardfork is just against principal."" consider a hypothetical example : what would happen if a contract was dictating that an atomic bomb that would explode  and the only way to diffuse it is to do a hardfork? if you don't everyone in the world would die except for you? You might go, no, it's against principals to do any forks, so yep just going to let everyone die,  why do you even need the system to be trustless then? The whole point of making the system trustless is so we are forced to NOT CHEAT as the ethics and procedures is reinforced not by a human but by these 'contracts' without needing everyone to trust each other and it usually works very well. 

But a machine is after all a dead entity and cannot know what is right or wrong. it only runs as programmed. Which means it cannot make an exception even if so many people have lost so much money because of it, in other words it cannot make any exception if it's doing something ""wrong"", it cannot make an exception even if it kills everyone in the world leaving no one else left to use it. But we can, and in this case, we SHOULD!

And a hardfork is democracy anyway, it'll only happen if majority of the people want it to happen. So if the majority of the ethereum community, like me, also think it SHOULD happen, then why not? Just like if someone were able to hack ethereum and drain all ethereum to one wallet except for 1 ether which is left in circulation, provided we've stopped the bug using a softfork, for those viewing ethereum as a trustless machine and how no one should interfere with that by principal, so we make do with that 1 ether in circulation??? Even tho majority of the people want it to change we still have to 'stick to principal'? That's BULLSHIT! I know i've used an extreme example to make the point to some people so they understand that given exceptional circumstances we should make exceptions, but honestly I'm just tired of people who are so stubborn with the philosophy of the 'trustless' system. It's only created because people wanted a way to make the world a better place and not worse, which isn't easy with stubborn people who loves to follow rules and principals regardless of circumstances.

1784,ethereum,A hard fork to give all ETH back to DAO holders is essentially sacrificing ETH holders for the sake of DAO holders.,"This hard fork will give ETH a very bad reputation. Ethereum should be agnostic to its contracts that it is executing. The network and the contracts should be independent from each other. This potential hard fork will set a very dangerous precedent. Let me quote the first paragraph on ethereum.org


&gt;Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.


The contracts **run exactly as programmed** without any possibility of downtime, **censorship**, fraud or third party interference.

By allowing the soft fork to censor the attackers contract, and the potential hard fork to give ETH back to the DAO holders, we are destroying the faith in the network. What's left over are a bunch of rules that **might** be enforced, there is no certainty anymore **because there are still human judges**.

Bailing out the DAO holders will put the whole project at risk. Somebody made a bad contract, this has nothing to do with the network! So why is there a need for a hard fork when this has nothing to do with the network? As I said in the beginning, ETH should be agnostic to its contracts to ensure trust in the system. Otherwise ETH will fail.

I have not yet seen a clear explanation from a fork supporter of what criteria are being used to decide when to freeze funds, and what criteria should be used in the future. 

Many of the arguments are similar to those made by governments when they justify bail outs. 

""The people losing money in the DAO are really rich and important and they're the ones driving the Ethereum economy forward -- we need to rescue them or Ethereum development will slow down""

""If these people lose money, the public will lose confidence and it will have ripple effects and hurt the entire Ethereum economy for years to come!""

""All we have to do is this one simple thing -- it's so easy to do, and it will get us out of the current crisis!""

Sound familiar?

In [this article](https://medium.com/@Alex_Amsel/understanding-proposed-ethereum-forks-6abd63a478fc#.zg03ltgw6), Alex Amsel says that we shouldn't worry about the principle of the ""law of code"", because ""this was the first DAPP."" Basically, this is a special circumstance and we won't make a habit of this. 

Sure, we won't be able to use the exact excuse ""but this is the first DAPP"" in the future, but why should I believe that other excuses that apply only to some situation that hasn't happened yet won't be equally convincing to the same people now pushing a fork?

""But.. this is a known ISIS account. It's a special circumstance!""

When people start clamoring in the future for funds to be frozen, what criteria will the community use to make the decision? 

Is it going to be ""if 51% of miners/stakers decide you don't deserve your coins, based on any reason they find convincing, you don't get them""? 

Do we want to have a system whose ground rules are as solid and predictable as we can make them, or do we want a system where miners act as a decentralized legal system? Which one will make people more willing to use Ethereum in the future?

The argument is ""we do have these principles that we'd ideally uphold, but let's not uphold them now because it's too soon.""

I think a key point is that it's not only important the Ethereum upholds these principles in the future, it's important that everyone fully **expects** Ethereum to uphold these principles in the future. The expectation is key. Otherwise, people won't trust it enough to build on it.

Assuming we don't want account blocking in the future, what can we do now to best set up Ethereum to be a system where people can trust that the community won't support account blocking?

1793,ethereum,"The current situation with The DAO is similar to the common situation of an End-User License Agreement; they're both contracts, and only a tiny amount of people read all of the fine print.","There was a [story in 2005](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20050223/1745244.shtml) about a guy who closely read the EULA for a program he was installing, and in that EULA there were instructions to send a specific email to a specific address, and the reward for doing so being $1000. It took a few months and thousands of downloads of this program before anyone actually sent the email and claimed the prize.

The situation with The DAO right now is incredibly similar. A lot of people have gotten involved in something they didn't understand and didn't read all of the fine print for. The fine print in the case of The DAO is code that probably the **vast** majority of Ethereum users absolutely *cannot* read--as they lack fluency in the language--but none the less, they functionally clicked ""I accept the terms of this agreement.""

To use a more real-world example analogy (which admittedly has shortcomings), everyone invested in The DAO bought a share of stock in a company. The agreement on the stock for this company dictates that any investor can initiate a reverse stock split and the split-initiating investor's stock splits in the opposite direction. So, after a while, an investor comes along and initiates just such a reverse stock split, causing every 100 shares to become 1 share, except for their shares, which are multiplied by 100. This is the closest analogy I can come up with for what happened with The DAO, and is the best interpretation I can offer of the agreement that all investors made, whether wittingly or not. The underlying problem here is that the language in the contract has the clause about the reverse-split initiating user getting to split their shares in the opposite direction; this is a flaw in the underlying language of smart contracts. In the current world of Ethereum, this clause has to be in a contract and is a fundamental flaw of contracts themselves.

There are two options, here. Either a) you adhere to the terms of the contract that many people agreed to but did not fully understand; or b) you undo the contract and everything that came with it.

Option ""a"" is not favored by most everyone invested in The DAO, because that means their investments are--either in whole or just in part--lost and gone forever. In the real-world stock market, though, this happens every day and is one of the potential consequences of investing in volatile new technology. Option ""a"" could be favored by those not invested in The DAO, as it doesn't affect them. Option ""a"" could also be favored by some that *are* invested in The DAO who believe fully that the contract is law and they are willing to take the hit on their bad investment.

Option ""b"" is not favored by those that have a long-term vested interest in Ethereum, both as a platform and as a currency; hard-forking the code fosters doubt and no-confidence. Suppose that a country's government ""decided"" that all currency minted in 2016 is invalid... that would be problematic, for obvious reasons; this is how a lot of people in the financial world are going to interpret a hard fork; it's also how a lot of users are going to see it too.

There is an underlying flaw here, which is a problem with the Ethereum code itself. The code (""language"") available for smart contracts does itself contain the flaw that was used to drain The DAO. The DAO by its nature was doomed to see this day due to a problem with the underlying code that defines the smart contract--that defines, as near as I can tell, any smart contract. I haven't done extensive research here, but I don't think that this scenario could have been avoided because the code doesn't exist to prevent it.

As I see it, there is an option ""c"": Amend the code of Ethereum smart contracts so that this cannot happen in the future, but accept that it has happened now and move on. Yes, it sucks that it happened. Yes, losing money on an investment is terribly disappointing.

Full disclosure: My Ether holdings are valued less than $1000 and I don't have a significant interest in any of the three options I listed above. If my Ether becomes worthless, then I will have lost $1000 and that will be okay because sometimes we lose money on investments, and those losses help us to shape our investment strategies in the future.",1466285707

1803,ethereum,Proposed Solution: Soft Fork + ChildDAO Asset Burn,"As I understand it, the current proposed solution to the DAO 'attack' will consist of 2 stages: 1) a soft fork carried out by the miners to freeze the ethereum balance of the parent DAO and all Child DAOs - this would effectively prevent any further 'theft' of the DAO balance utilizing the same attack vector and also prevent the transfer of ethereum from any associated Child DAOs, essentially an asset freeze (note that DAO tokens can still be freely traded), and 2) a yet undecided action to determine the fate of the 'stolen' 3.6m ethereum frozen in the Child DAO (it has been suggested that this could include a proposed hard fork to return the 'stolen' ethereum to the parent DAO).

As I understand, the first stage soft fork to freeze the DAO balance and prevent further 'theft' will be available to the miners in the coming days. What I propose is in terms of the second stage action: instead of returning the ethereum in the ChildDAO to the parent DAO and risk the decentralized immutable nature of the network, I propose that this 3.6m ethereum be somehow 'burned' or made permanently unavailable for future transactions.

IMO this both preserves the decentralized / immutable / fungible nature of the ethereum network while also respecting the free/open market such that the investors of the DAO (of which I am one) would not be treated as 'too big to fail' through an unjustified and uncalled for market intervention at the expense of the ethereum ecosystem.

tl;dr - freeze then 'burn' the 3.6m eth.

Well all is not lost. If you are a DAO token holder and don't have an appetite for risk, you can sell your DAO tokens for ETH, at a loss. It's currently around 60-70% of the value - not nearly the same as losing everything which some people are acting like (margin traders on other hand who did lose everything, I feel terrible for you, but I learned my lesson not to margin trade years ago and always advise against it). Again taking a significant hair cut sucks, but you still have most of your position. Again I feel your pain I was a holder too.

By selling the tokens to the market you'll let less risk averse speculators to buy DAO tokens in hopes that miners hard fork to a solution returning the DAO tokens to full value.


That being said, I think its extremely likely miners would at least soft fork to block the hacker from using any funds, so I don't think these stolen coins are going to hit the market, and finally keep in mind Ethereum itself is still whole, and has a sizable user base which I would say justifies the lowest end price at a minimum of around $5 (not trading advise, just my perspective from keeping my pulse in the market since the beginning of Ethereum's existence).

That is all, just wanted to share my thoughts to calm the market, I know a lot of people don't know what's going on, and some people less connected to what's going on may think there's something wrong with Ethereum itself, which is not the case, Ethereum is fine, this will resolve itself over the coming weeks.",1466292594

The discussion has shown many people the fact that everything can be changed by humans, if everyone, or at least the majority, agrees on it. Which means smart contracts are only unchangeable when the majority agrees they are.

But this shouldve been clear from the beginning. Where's the news?

I don't see why forking would change the inherent nature of ethereum, the simple fact that it can be forked already betrays the absolutist idea of ""no one can change anything"". People who talk like this apparently would rather jump from a cliff believing in their illusions than adopt to cold hard reality.

Trustless ends where the majority of people agree on a change, because thats how the blockchain works.

The truth is that only a few people within the ecosystem control the majority vote with their enormous social and technical influence, at least at the moment.

1859,ethereum,"The Ethereum/DAO ""Etherton"" analogy","There was a company that realized it needed a safer building to hold its assets. It let its investors know what was going on and started construction on a new, better building. However, one of the investors was looking closely at the original building one day and saw that it was actually much weaker than anyone thought. He saw that there was a way he could walk in and take everything, so he goes in, steals everything, and makes a break for it.

&amp;nbsp;

The company, called Dow, immediately begins weighing its options. The simplest thing to do is accept the loss by doing nothing. This would destroy Dow, but at the end of the day all investors know that they are not guaranteed positive returns. Besides, even if they believed in the business plan of Dow they could have done better due diligence by inspecting the building themselves. But then the company realizes something: It turns out the thief only had a bike and small trailer, and is so slow and weighed down that it's going to take him 27 days to make it out of town. This generates a few more ideas.

&amp;nbsp;

First, Dow could try calling the police so they could intercept the thief before he leaves town. However, that's not how things work in Etherton. Etherton is a small but growing community that has leaders but no centralized law enforcement. This is by design: The citizens have been pretty successful governing themselves with a small set of rules that were established early on. These rules favor autonomy and decentralization. They also don't interfere with individual companies, so they're not immediately helpful for Dow.

&amp;nbsp;

What about getting help from another town? Usaville, Euberg, and Chinatown all have police forces and centralized authority. Maybe they could come over and intercept the thief? Unfortunately, neither Dow nor Etherton have confidence in the centralization of power in these towns. In fact, one of the reasons they came to Etherton in the first place was to avoid putting all of the power and control into the hands of a few. But even putting aside ideological differences, the police forces of these towns are ill-equipped to deal with the unique rules and structure of Etherton. Furthermore, these towns often struggle with collaboration and it is unclear which subset of them should be asked to help. Finally, many people worry if these towns even have the resources to make it in 27 days anyway. So external help is not likely.

&amp;nbsp;

Even though the laws of Etherton don't meddle with the operations of individual companies, the citizens of Etherton still want Dow to resolve this mess. Dow is one of the first and largest companies in Etherton and is a significant part of its economy. Etherton would probably survive without Dow, but the consequences of a successful heist might cripple it: Etherton would send the message that it is utterly incapable of stopping a 27-day heist on a bicycle down main street. This lackluster level of confidence would certainly drive companies to leave Etherton and cause many innovating entrepreneurs to take their ideas to other towns instead. So is Etherton's decentralization powerless to stop the heist?

&amp;nbsp;

In order to get off the ground, Etherton was bootstrapped by a large number of centralized decisions by its early founders and leaders. Since then the laws of Etherton have allowed the citizens to regulate themselves mostly with autonomy and decentralization. However, there was no way for the founders to guarantee that these original laws would remain completely sufficient and relevant for all possible scenarios of the future. Because of this, as Etherton has grown and evolved its leaders have made several proposals which have been accepted or rejected by the community. This is how Etherton has addressed the apparent paradox of maintaining decentralization and leadership presence.

&amp;nbsp;

The leaders of Etherton are watching the thief ride his way through town with all of Dow's assets, and decide to make a proposal. The Dow's assets are a large collection of bills with known unique serial numbers. Rather than chase the thief, the leaders propose that in Etherton it is easier to invalidate the stolen serial numbers and issue a new set of bills with new serial numbers to Dow for the same amount. This stops the heist dead in its tracks, but requires updating the laws. The citizens of Etherton choose whether or not to accept the proposal based on their judgment of the situation. Those who accept the proposal will honor the new bills and reject the old bills, rendering them useless. Those who reject the proposal will honor the old bills but not the new ones. In the end, the group with the most votes will become the new Etherton. This is because even though the minority group could leave and form their own town, they risk forming a town whose currency is not honored by most people. Because of this risk, they are more likely to integrate with the majority. No matter the outcome, the leaders would not be forcing a change and decentralization would be maintained.

&amp;nbsp;

It is our turn to decide the end of this story. The question is not about maintaining decentralization. We have already incorporated many leader-proposed changes to Ethereum and will continue to incorporate changes in the future. The question is not about immutability or fungibility. A quorum of more than 50% can create any scenario it wants. The question is simply whether we will allow a quorum change to involve a contract or not. If yes, then nothing is different; we have shown yet again that a quorum of greater than 50% can make changes to the blockchain. If no, then we show that Ethereum chose to let a ""bicycle"" thief ride away over 27 days with the assets of its users, and we hope that this doesn't cause current and future users and developers to find other solutions outside of Ethereum.",1466298387
1860,ethereum,By not punishing hackers we create an imbalance between rewards for following the rules and rewards for breaking them,"If you follow the Ethereum rules you may, if you are lucky double your money in 1 year or so.
If you work for 1 year to find a way to hack a system you may make $3mil , $50m or even $150m dollars. That is more than everybody makes in a whole lifetime.

Therefore, by not punishing the DAO hacker we are incentivizing every single employee of every single company who has access to their cryptocurrency wallet to steal or hack away as much as they can get away with.

The math is simple: if I try to hack and succeed I am all set for life. If I try to hack and fail there is no punishment. If I follow the rules I get barely enough money to live. 

If we really want real money to get into crypto currencies we NEED to punish hackers.

TL; DR;  by not punishing the DAO hacker we are incentivizing every single employee of every single company who has access to their cryptocurrency wallet to steal or hack away as much as they can get away with.

[You can see my concern over this a year ago] (https://m.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3evsl4/what_are_the_cons_of_ethereum/). I believe giving miners the ability to exclude blocks with transactions they disagree with solves a big problem we were about to face.  ETH is fundamentally different than Bitcoin.

Imagine you have a giant cookie jar (TheDAO.) Everyone brought their cookies (Ether) to put into the jar, and got muffins (TheDAO tokens) in return.

However, someone finds out that if you kick the jar just right, you can get your hand past the electronic lock and open more times than normally allowed. (Recursive calling vulnerability.) The people who made the jar (DAO developers) don't fix the jar because the trick is difficult to do.

One day, a random guy (The attacker) comes by, does the trick, and begins to steal all the cookies, but he stops once the jar's CEO (Vitalik) comes by and threatens to make a new one.",1466299370

The format is open for discussion but perhaps:

1. We set a simple task the smart contracts must perform e.g. a token crowdsale or a wallet.

2. There is a maximum length for submissions to keep things reviewable.

3. The code is run on the test net and can then be analyzed by community members (extra incentives?).

4. The winner keeps ETH their contract stole and becomes world's most underhanded solidity programmer.

1867,ethereum,Dark DAO token solution for 100% return?,"I believe collusion can allow the dao, the attacker and ethereum to get out with less pain/more money.

If the attacker had monetised through a short then here is a way for them to monetise through a long, avoid a hard fork, possibly a soft fork (more controversial) and return everyone's money 100%. This may have been the plan all along.

1) Long ether

2) Send 100% of the dark dao tokens to e.g. Vitalik. Could they even go direct to the curator contract? The dark dao, if no splits and no other tokens, is 100% owned by a trusted member. The dark dao has tokens just like the main dao.

3) Member forks the dark dao safely. The dark dao curator is the attacker so no other proposal can work unless they add curators and remove themselves without a fork (actually, this may be possible which simplifies things - does someone know?). Also assumes extraBalance is 0 which it probably is (can be checked).

4) Soft fork to lock down dao contracts. This is still needed as a matter of urgency because the main dao is susceptible but there is a solution to avoid even a single soft fork (incurs more centralised risk in a key holder of an existing split). NOTE: There is a way to avoid any soft fork, see below.

5) Soft fork again with solution to recover main dao funds (if soft fork required)

6) Remove soft fork to allow dark dao to split and funds to be extracted

100% return possible, no hard fork required for certain, no funds stolen, no ether goes up. Profit.

Risks: The attacker most likely profited from shorts on exchanges already but he may have done this indirectly through others. The exchanges generally know identities so doing it again probably isn't an extra risk and could be hidden amongst other longs perhaps. In any case, trades are only circumstantial evidence.

To be clear, this requires the attacker to do actions 1-3 (and 2 in public view) but it's a profitable action for basically everyone. 

A soft fork can also be avoided by making use of a certain child dao, but it would mean all dao tokens would need to be sent to a trusted key holder as quickly as possible, before any other dao attack. It's possible that a self-attack (on the same principle) could also empty the dao quickly and safely as MakerDAO did. An self-attack would empty the dao and could be preferable but would have to be done carefully.

This would load the risk back on dao token holders and away from ethereum but it does carry keyholder risk of course.

1868,ethereum,Ppease Remain Calm: Regardless of the outcome Ether will survive.,"I have stated many times that I am a pre-sale buyer. I don't trade.  My first and only investment was The DAO and since it was like an Option where I was promised a full refund at anytime prior to the first Proposal, I figured it was low risk and I put in half (3K) of my Ether. That's a shit ton of money.

But I'm not freaking out just yet. I'm actually interested in the social dynamics we're going through right now as a community. I am, of course, in favour of a full refund from The DAO, but there are arguments on both sides.

Some argue immutability of code, but I'd argue that money (programmable or otherwise) is a social contract first and anything else second.

The decisions we make in the next few days and weeks will set a precedent about the social contract we have in Ether and with each other. One side may say that reversing transactions is a slippery slope towards censorship, but allowing the funds to be stolen is exactly the opposite slippery slope.

Not reversing TheDAO experiment defines the Ethereum social contract as one of apathy and says we will let *anything* slide regardless of how bad it may be. It says we don't care about anyone but ourselves and the purity of the code. It also says to all would-be scammers that it's open season and if you can sneak a bug into a contract and can get some good advertisement to raise fund you can steal it all and we'll just let you.

What if Bitcoin could have reversed its Mt Gox fiasco? How many more scams would have never bothered trying knowing the community could have reversed those too?

If Bitcoin or even the apathy of The DAO has taught us anything so far, it's that decentralization does not spontaneously form governance. We must actively work towards governance that is fair, reasoned and nuanced. Nothing is black and white here except the blockchain. The blockchain gives us transparency, but it doesn't give us nuance. Only the users can decide that.

I think we're all adults and can understand nuance. Some times it's ok to let bad things happen for the greater good, but sometimes it's not. In this case I believe reversal is the right choice.

If not that, then at least scorch the fucking earth and burn my DAO tokens. If I can't have them, I don't want him to either.",1466299933

1870,ethereum,A perspective rant on permitting a fork of Ethereum to resolve a major exploit or loss,"We keep talking about this whole DAO fork debate like Ethereum was a currency. Ethereum was designed to facilitate smart contracts. The idea that the ""code is law"" is the basis of such smart contracts. That being said, we could consider Ethereum based platforms such as TheDAO to be a digital contract that very well may contain loopholes. Much like a real life contract, there will be loopholes that a party will exploit -- and thus requires a lawyer and judge to sort out. If it's a negligible loss because of the loophole, lawyers don't get involved. If millions of dollars at stake, then they do.

So I think having a fork is a good idea, because ultimately the miners decide whether to make the implementation. An analogy -- the fork proposal is like the attorney coming to defend against a contract exploitation, while miners are the judge. Knowing that future major losses due to exploitation or loopholes can be combated against will enable trust and ultimately more wide adoption of Ethereum. This is what can set it apart from Bitcoin. I don't consider Vitalik's fork proposal to be a 'bailout' but rather a fallback shield against the imperfections of human programming (there will always be human error, especially if a DApp is designed by a small startup with limited staff).

I firmly believe that no smart contract will ever be perfect -- how can we 100% certain that there are no loopholes or bugs from the entity that created the DApp? Sure, we can all review the open source code of a DApp but then Ethereum will never be mainstream since not everyone are coders.

I believe if Vitalik and the Ethereum foundation played upon this idea as a positive concept for a fork, then mainstream PR will eat it up and may help push further Ethereum adoption. This wouldn't set a precedent for ""centralization"" manipulation of Ethereum, but rather set the precedent for a second layer of security to poorly designed smart contracts.",1466300247

**The Proposal:**

  We do the hard fork and make it as expensive as the community decides it should be. The clients that participate and form a successful hard fork should get paid to do so by mining during a certain period using the designated clients. This payment hinges on the success of the fork.


Why I like it:

   - It maintains the integrity of ethereum miners due to this being in the interest of the majority of the community. I understand this is debatable, but given the lack of identity and reputation system I am pretty sure they can get away with it for now.

   - It allows for at least some if not most of the ether lost to be returned to the speculators.

   - It allows for the ethereum community members to participate and at least get some possible compensation for the damage this has caused.

   - It also removes any conflict of interest since anyone can participate in the proceeds of this action.


 

It is up to theDAO stake holders to figure out how much it would cost to get the community on board. This is of course assuming they can come to a consensus on anything at this point. The exploiter could come out and counter this, but it is anyone's guess what the exploiter is thinking or willing to do at this point.

This was a reasonable response to learning of the DAO exploit, given all the rules of the system.

But now people are talking about the Ethereum network doing something to retrieve the lost ether. This is *changing the very rules that those who sold their DAO tokens were operating by*. If they had known that the DAO would be bailed out by Ethereum miners led by Buterin, they obviously would not have sold their DAO tokens at a loss. Even if people had known, going into the attack, that this was simply a practical possibility, people would have acted differently. Prices would have been different.

**Right now, if the Ethereum network does successfully retrieve the lost ether, it still leaves all those who responded rationally according to the rules, and sold their DAO tokens at a loss, out a ton of money.** Why are we only bailing out DAO token holders who have kept their DAO tokens since the attack? Plus, we'd be massively enriching people who bought all the cheap tokens.

How is this fair? Is it ""heartless"" to leave those who sold their DAO tokens at a loss out of the ""bailout""?

Of course, at this point, it simply would not be feasible to undo all the trades that have happened. **My point is that, at this point, a ""bailout"" would not at all simply be ""returning stolen money back to their owners.""** Instead, it's helping people who have taken a particular response to the attack.

Everyone knew that the DAO was extremely risky and that a software bug could end it (the DAO website itself listed this among risks). So it happened - act accordingly. Investments fail all the time. Losing money in an investments hurts, but that's why you have the possibly of gain in taking a risk in the first place. Everyone knew the rules going in.

This guy raised some excellent points.

I am speaking out as a long-term ethereum holder because I believe that there is a silent majority here of holders that is being drowned out by the vocal minority of jealous haters, trolls and shorters.

Money brings out the very worst in human nature.
The bitcoin maximalists and competitors and those who missed out at the ICO are very much enjoying the suffering here. Many of them are definitely trying to bait us to make the wrong decision, in order to remove their competition and profit.

Ethereum must do what is in the best interest of ethereum; not what is ""pure"" or ""just"" in the warped mind of a crypto purist who is scared of their bitcoin/crypto investment devaluing against ethereum.

If the bitcoiners could have fixed the mt gox fiasco so cleanly with a fork, they would have. They didn't have that option because it went over the course of years and was too mixed up by the time it was discovered.

So many strawmen arguments and double standard/ hypocritical arguments from those disruptive bitcoin trolls. Too many to count. Bitcoin have forked when it was in the best interest of the majority before too (when the supply was inflated 100000x overnight by some random bug). We can now fork because it is in super majority's interest. We can fork. It's in our best self-interest to fork. We should fork.

We are not forking to save DAO holders. The reason to fork is to remove 5% of the eth supply from someone who stole that supply and views ethereum as a ""shit coin"". The reason to fork is to not allow a distribution of a large magnitude to a malevolent actor. The reason to fork is to protect ourselves and our future.

The truth is that they are highly threatened by the chance that ethereum will overtake bitcoin and errode their investments.
They are here pretending to care and telling us to not act in our own best interest in order to undermine us, in order to disrupt us and ultimately, in order to destroy us.

Please miners. I urge you to ignore the concern trolls and the shorters and the crypto purists and the bitcoin maximalists. 
Please do not let these trolls muddy the waters. Don't let them try to create the impression that the community is divided.
Please act in your own best interests and the best interests of Ethereum. Soft fork and remove the control of 5% of ether supply from the exploiter. Then we can discuss what to do at length.

Good luck to all.

For those of you that lost money in the DAO.  I'm sorry, but there's still hope for recovery of most of your funds without a hard fork. And to quote one of my favorite shows.

1912,ethereum,"Some ppl here need to chill out, stop the hatred towards Slock.it, The DAO and the people behind it. And I'll tell you WHY...","The intentions of The DAO and the people behind the contract have always been clear:

**Create a Smart Contract that gathers funds and then give these funds to various startups, boosting growth of the ethereum community, boosting growth of Ethereum applications and increase implementation.**

This was all good intention and, if successful, would've been great for Ethereum as a whole.


It was backed by the creators of Ethereum for the exact same reasons.

It was backed by a lot of Ethereum investors for again the exact same reasons.

A lot of Ethereum investors have put their funds on the line to benefit everyone in the Ethereum space.

There have been other people who didn't want to take the risk, fair enough, **but they would've whole hardheartedly enjoyed reaping the benefits of a successful DAO**.

Now it are majorly these latter people who are spreading their hate and discontent towards anyone who has either created or supported The DAO. This is highly immature in my opinion.

The DAO was an interesting idea and its founders have put their hearth into this project. Their perseverance, their commitment and their enthusiasm has lead The DAO to gather way more funds than they had ever projected.


But unfortunately there was a severe bug. Any programmer with experience knows that bugs are a pain in the ass to discover, or fix, or even understand. The people behind The DAO have been working hard for 7 months to make sure there were no bugs, but unfortunately one severe one remained. Sorry, they are not superheroes but apparently they seemed to be human after all.


As every programmer, also these people knew there was the possibility of a bug. But that didn't keep them from being enthusiastic about their project, and rightfully so. 

Unfortunately, the sum of the circumstances, with The DAO attracting so much funds that an eventual bug could mean catastrophe, has indeed lead to catastrophe.


We have to figure out **how we fix this shit**. This isn't a game about **how we are going to punish all the people who stood behind this project.** Stop vilifying people like Stephan Tual for trying to build something great for the community. Stop vilifying Vitalik for defending this entire project, simple because he also had funds invested in it because he loved the idea and wanted to support it.

Stop being so childish, stop being so selfish, stop all the fucking hatred. We are all human and humans make mistakes. It's important we fix them and learn from them,  so we can move on and come stronger out of this.

**To all of you who weren't invested in The DAO and are hating on this situation:**

I understand your frustration, but everything that has been done was out of good intent and now it's your time to shine and show your good intent. Stop the hate, and start the support. 

If you really care about Ethereum, that is.

If The DAO worked and would've helped hundreds of start ups, you would have all praised the Ethereum project to heaven, reaped in the benefits, and that all without ever having to put your own money on the line for the DAO tokens you didn't buy.

**The money that's on the line is money that was entirely meant for start ups, for growth in the Ethereum ecosystem.** Not supporting a reversal of these transactions means you are getting more joy from seeing investors burn than having money flow to Ethereum growth. That isn't what I'd call a mature attitude.

1913,ethereum,The big theDAO heist FAQ,"The big theDAO heist FAQ

**What happened?**
3,641,694 ETH where splitted out of theDAO. The attacker found a loophole in the regular splitDAO function so that they could reuse the same DAO tokens over and over again.


**How did the attack worked exactly?**
The attacker managed to combine 2 exploits. The first exploit was to call the split DAO function recursively. That means the first regular call would trigger a second (irregular) call of the function and the second call would trigger another call and so on. The following calls are done in a state before the balance of the attacker is set back to 0. This allowed the attacker to split 20 times (have to look up the exact number) per transaction. He could not do more - otherwise the transactions would have gotten too big and eventually would have reached the block limite. This attack would already have been painful. However - what made it really painful is that the attacked managed to replicate this attack from the same two addresses with the same tokens over and over again (roughly 250 times from 2 addresses each). So the attacker found a second exploit that allowed to split without destroying the tokens in the main DAO. They managed to transfer the tokens away before they get sent to address 0x0 and only after this they are sent back)
The combination of both attacks multiplied the effect. Attack one on its one would have been very capital intensive (you need to bring up 1/20 of the stolen amount upfront) - the attack two would have taken a long time. 


**Is the remaining Ether in theDAO safe?**
No - it is most likely that this exploit could have been used to drain all Ether out of theDAO. The attacker stopped draining ETH when Vitalik wrote his first blog response that mentioned the plan for soft and hard forks. We can assume that the hacker stopped for strategic reasons to make a community decision for a fork less likely. However - the attacked voted in other fork proposals as well - for more details have a look [here](http://imgh.us/The_attack_graph_03.svg)

**Update 06/21:**
*Another comment - in the case that the execution of some fork is announced it will take some time to activate this fork. In this case I think it is very likely that we will see more attacks on the DAO - not unlikely that all ETH will be drained. In this case: DO NOT PANIC. This would be expected and there are options to restore all ETH.*


**Since the Ether of the attacker is in a copy of a theDAO contract - can the ETH be stolen the same way?**
This would have been possible if at least one honest actor would have voted for this split. Since the attacker is most likely the only shareholder and the curator of this DAO the same attack can not be done.

**Update 06/20:**
*Lefteris Karapetsas found out a way how to enter the ""darkDAO"" - this allows indeed to counter attack the ""darkDAO"" and all other potential thefts.  This means that all ETH can be restored with soft forks only - read more [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4ov5yi/all_eth_can_be_restored_with_soft_forks_only/)*

**How would the proposed soft fork work?**
The soft fork would be an immediate action to mainly buy time. Miners could modify the Ethereum client that it would ignore all transactions where as a result of the transaction ETH is deducted from an address that has the code of theDAO. Miners would also ignore blocks of other miners that would include such a transaction. If the majority of miners decides to do so it would be impossible for everyone to move ETH from every ""theDAO"" version. So it would affect the main ""theDAO"" and all the splits - including the regular and the malicious one.

**Is a software version of ETH with this modification already available?**
Yes - Parity and GETH have released proper versions.

**What needs to happen to activate the soft fork?**
It would require a coordinated effort of the majority of the miners. Coordination is important otherwise a miner would likely lose his ETH. If you for example solo mine you should NOT switch to the patched version unless you are convinced that a majority of the miners did because otherwise your software will ignore the longest chain since it would see it as invalid.

Miners need to communicate with each other and define a block in the future that should be used to switch over to the new version. As soon as the majority accepts a new version it is dangerous for a miner not to use the new version.

**If the soft fork succeeds - what is a path forward**
The softfork will most likely only a temporary solution. If it would be the final solution it would mean that basically all ETH on all theDAO contracts is frozen forever. There are two more likely paths forward. First a hard fork - with a hard fork literally everything is possible - we will discuss likely paths later. The second path from the freez softfork is to allow only certain kind of transactions. Under the assumption that no more ETH is drained from theDAO a more specific softfork 2 could allow every DTH to receive its share of the remaining ETH.

**If the soft fork does not succeed - what will happen?**
A very big mess of attacks and counter attacks. White and black heat hacker will start exploiting this bug. However since every split will be public everyone can join every split. The right strategy would be to split you tokens up to have a very small number of tokens in every split. So if someone is performing the attack others will also have shares in the splitted DAO - that will allow them later to perform this attack again in the newDAO after the creation period is over. This could result in endless splitting. It would create incentives to spam the network or to bribe miners to censor transactions. In addition it is very likely that other bugs will be found and exploited. If we would end up in this stage it is very likely that all non technical DTH would lose everything.

**What are the arguments for and against the soft fork?**
The biggest argument for the soft fork is the prevention of the huge mess that would occur without one. There are philosophical arguments against it - essentially the softfork would be a form of censorship. However - most affected by this censorship would highly welcome it (all DAO token holder) expect the attacker. However - there is a small group of people also affected by this who not might want it - everyone who spitted in a regular manner and is confident that no one of the other shareholder in this splitted DAO will atack them (e.g. because they are the only one).

**When and how is a hard fork possible?**
A hard fork would require longer discussion and consensus finding. To execute a hard fork miners are less important. More important are exchanges and key player in the ecosystem. (Ethereum foundation, core developers, leading companies in the ecosystem). If all those players agree to a hard fork even a small minority of miners would be enough but more importantly - miners would join under those conditions almost for sure. With a hard fork in principal ALL rule changes are possible. New Ether can be created, legit ETH can be destroyed and so on. However - chances are 0 that the community would agree on such a fork. So we can narrow the expected range down. On the upper end (on a scale of ETH value per DAO-token) would be a complete reversion of all illegitimate splits. That would mean that DAO tokens could again be redeemable of 0.01ETH each. The lower end would be the ratio of ETH that is left in theDAO contract - currently 0.006857 ETH (without extra balance) . However - for such a solution no hard fork would be required, it could be done with a soft fork. So a consensus solution might also be that only parts are restored. Others could be either destroyed or be used for some form of common good (e.g. Ethereum foundation, decentralized fund that will subsidize future security audits, )

**Additional information:**


**What is the difference between a hard and a soft fork.**
A soft fork means that a state/block that used to to be valid is not valid any more in the new version. In this case a state that would result in spending ETH from any contract with the code of theDAO would be considered invalid. A hard fork makes a state valid that was not valid before. The big advantage of a soft fork is that only miners need to update their software. Although eventually everyone should - if everyone waits for enough confirmations they will only accept states that are valid under the new rules. In a hard fork however everyone (consumers, exchanges, ...) need to update their software. Otherwise they are in danger of losing their ETH and other assets on Ethereum. For this reason the period between agreement on the fork and execution of the fork should be much bigger than it can be in a soft fork.


**Can we track down the identity of the attacker.**
This is an open question. There is a decent likelihood that the attack was not planned long in advance so the hacker might have done mistakes as using addresses that are linkable to their identity. Here is an [excellent overview](https://medium.com/@oaeee/the-attack-story-38f4789b3c3b#.5bavv3vmp) of the accounts involved. The hacker was careful and used only ETH from a transaction from shapeshift.

**When did the hacker started to plan this attack?**
The two key contracts that held the tokens and had the logic in that allowed the recursive split where created 2 days before the attack. So at least two days. However - a split was initiated 7 days before the attack. However - it is not yet 100% clear if the attacker and the initiator of that split are the same. It likely but not necessary. The attacker could have used any split proposal. But even if the attacker was the initiator of the split it does not mean that they were preparing the attack already back then. Under the assumption that theDAO was bug free there has been an arbitrage opportunity of buying DAO tokens for less than 0.01ETH and converting them to 0.01ETH with a split.

**If the soft fork is implemented - can I still transfer DAO Tokens?**
Yes - every transaction that does not affect the ETH balance of a contract with the code of theDAO is still possible. More details around different fork solutions can be found [here](https://medium.com/@Alex_Amsel/understanding-proposed-ethereum-forks-6abd63a478fc#.ogdrszob3)

I've seen arguments here to the effect that making investors or the DAO whole does not create moral hazard because nobody is being ""bailed out"" by taxpayers.

I'm not sure this is 100% of the story.

It is true that nobody is coming to me asking directly for my ether to give to someone else to cover the cost of their mistakes. At least we have *that* over fiat.

However I think losses are still being distributed over all ether holders when in fairness they should be distributed only over investors in the DAO and slock.it:

As a holder who did not invest in the DAO due to my perception of its risk, I am being punished by the market by the failure of the DAO even though I did not invest in it. From where I sit, I'm paying a penalty for slock.it's negligence and lack of due diligence on the part of investors.

In other words losses are still subsidized by all holders. That creates the potential for moral hazard. They (slock.it and DAO investors) should pay 100% of the losses inasfar as possible.

The way this is achieved is by locking up the stolen coins. Permanently removing a large percentage of the money from the money supply bolsters price for all holders, alleviating the tax levied on us by slock.it and its investors. Instead, investors and slock.it are on the hook financially for the fuckup.

I do think both sides have great arguments that should be considered heavily. At the very least this event will go down in history as ""one of the big ones"", but I could also go down as the time when a new type of mindset prevailed:

Proposal: 
1 why insist on the fact that blockchain history can never be reversed?
2 blockchain technology relies on 51% agreement
3 if 51% agree on a history that is different than the current reality, shouldn't that always be embraced? (Here we basically roam into the territory of: is democracy good?)
4 supporting a certain version of history is voting, at the very last we should all get the option to vote
5 how about voting with your ether? Why should only miners be allowed to cast their vote? Some people are invested much more than just having bought some equipment. Make miners cast vote with mining new ether. And give the rest of people a smart contract that counts your ether same as voting tokens.

What I'm proposing here completely negates the view of: how many more times do we have to fork again, how big of a failure justifies a fork, should we ever or never fork?
I say we should always:
1 sit down
2 debate 
3 vote
4 fork/not fork depending on the voting outcome 

Two more thoughts on this philosophy:
1 we're growing here, we're learning, I really don't think anyone can argue that. If you fall down and break your leg, do you avoid going to the doctor, because in a sense he is changing history by repairing your broken leg? Should you have a stump to learn to never fuck up your leg again? If you don't agree with the doctor comparison, the imagine we're in the future where trauma doctors no longer give you casts or operate, but use time travel to go back in time to catch you before you fall, should these time machines be banned?
2 if you agree that we're growing Ethereum and shouldn't change the past when we can, why should we be allowed to change the future by forking into an upgrade. Think about it, in a way using blockchain technology in a way allowes us to move in the space-time continuum more freely than in our beloved meat-space. Isn't this magnificent? 
3 If you buy into the space-time continuum argument, how is forking now, where we have seen an action that was malicious and unwanted (I suspect the vast majority of 90%+ will agree on this), different than fixing the issue before it would have been exploited? 

Please argue gracefully in these testing times, otherwise we're not much more than a horde of savages. Let's make a precedent for a first truly 21st century avant-grade socio/economic/political history, regardless of your opinion on the way forward regarding forking/not forking/other actions and your possible general philosophical sway: left, right, conservative, avant-garde, liberal, radical, green, social, etc. ",1466327877

1940,ethereum,PROPOSAL: Ethereum Contract Incubation System,"I would like to propose and discuss a new ""Ethereum Contract Incubation System"" feature. 


**PROPOSAL:**

An ethereum contract developer MUST be able deploy a new contract in ""incubated"" mode. A ""Rescue team"" can gain control over such “incubated” contract account in case of disaster and save the money according “Rescue Policy”. Any ethereum user MUST be able to check the “incubation” status of the contract before sending funds. If contract is not marked as “incubated”, it remains fully decentralized as any other “usual” contract now. It MUST be possible to turn irreversibly the contract from ""incubation"" mode into “production” (fully decentralized) mode. ""Rescue Team"" and “Rescue Policy” SHOULD be hard coded into EVM and SHOULD be the same for all “recoverable” contracts. 


**SHORT JUSTIFICATION:**

Ethereum and new contract users need bug safety more than decentralization, matured projects are more worried about decentralization. Today real-life tests and reviews begin after contract is deployed and holds real money. It is too late. We should offer a ""switch"" between ""incubation"" and ""matured"" mode.


**LONG JUSTIFICATION:**

Contract development is trickier and more error-prone than usual software development. If Ethereum will acquire more and more new contract developers, it MUST accept the fact, that many of theirs contracts will fail because of bugs and lack of experience. Non-professional users, in contrast, expect bug free contracts like any other financial software. Ethereum MUST respect their expectation as well, if it will gain wide user acceptance. We have huge EXPECTATION GAP here and it is responsibility of Ethereum to close it.

The second GAP is in testing motivation. Developer are usually motivated to get product ready on time, in budget and according with current rules of development and test process. Find all possible bugs is neither the manager’s goal nor developer’s. Investors and hackers, in contrast, are much more motivated to find any exploitable bug. This leads to banana-software where investors and hackers are treated as tester for the deployed software (i.e. “community review”). But nobody will spend time and money to test and review undeployed (unfinished) software, just because there is nothing to get there and nothing to be afraid of. Therefore, only live release (of possibly buggy software) create sufficient motivation for investors and to find all bugs. It is a second MOTIVATION GAP Ethereum have to solve. 

The «incubated» Contract is not really decentralized. But not every contract needs to be decentralized. Many new contracts “in evaluation” phase do not. Possible bugs are much more dangerous for the new (and possibly buggy) contracts than the lack of contract’s decentralization. For matured contracts with real business attached on it, full decentralization is more important and bugs are (hopefully) already fixed. 

I believe we can start without full decentralization in “incubation” mode and add decentralization to contracts later, in “production” phase. It provides an Emergency Stop Button for contracts in “incubation”. If not stopped by “Rescue Team”, contract can turn into fully decentralized mode after some time period. 

I make no concrete proposal about “rescue team” and “rescue protocol” now, but I think it could be set up if the core idea is considered to be useful. 

**IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:**

Contract developer SHOULD NOT implement ""rescue strategy"" on its own: if we consider the new contract could be buggy, we should consider custom ""rescue"" strategy could be buggy as well. It SHOULD NOT be a standard solidity library, because it can be wrong used or not used at all (but claimed to be used).
 
“Emergency Stop Button” SHOULD be standard feature of Ethereum EVM, it SHOULD be well known protocol to rescue funds from buggy contract and offer standard and simple way to proof whether some contract is recoverable or not (just an info in Wallet).

Contract running mode (“production” or “incubation”) MUST be clearly visible in Ethereum Wallet for every user who sends money to the contract. 
Ethereum wallet SHOULD show running mode and running times. 

Example 1: contract AAA is running in “production” mode since 2 years. (LOW RISK, matured contract)  

Example 2: contract BBB is running in “incubation” mode since 5 days. (HIGH RISK, but incubated)

Example 3: contract CCC is running in “production” mode since 5 days. (VERY HIGH RISK, unstoppable)

1954,ethereum,The DAO Hack. A Lesson in true decentralisation.,"So lots of people are talking about the hack. Some are assigning blame. Some are spreading FUD. Some are working tirelessly to resolve the issue. 

Lets talk about something else.

What will the next DAO look like? What does the way forward look like for decentralised anonymous organisations.

First a post mortem.

1. TheDAO was a product of Slock.it. The code was rushed, the governance weak and untested. It was a an application designed to fill a philosophical gap. Slock it wanted funding, but they weren't keen on any kind of ICO. It grew and rebelled against its parents. 
2. It was a massive target. It was decentralised in nature, but also a massive single point of failure for the concept of DAO's. It wasn't finished, due to its rushed philosophical underpinning. It was the biggest cookie jar on the internet and someone figured out how to get their hands in. 
3. The demand was obvious. People want a provably fair organisation to exist. 

So how do we address these issues?

1. We need more than 1 or 2 groups working on DAO code. We desperately need to decentralise the development. I also think Slock.It should bow out of the process from here. I welcome their advocacy for their preferred fork solution to resolve issues of their creation, however I think any future DAO project with their involvement will not have any legitimacy.
2. We need investment caps. Future DAO's with credibility should have a target, and stop funding at that target. These targets should be related the security history of their code base and efforts put into auditing their code. Effectively a DAO paternity test. While we are testing the concept of a DAO, and within 12 months of this issue, we really should not have another DAO contract with more than 100,000 USD of ETH.
3. Single Issue DAO's. Sort of part of my previous point, for the foreseeable future we should limit the intent of each DAO project. A DAO for universal sharing. A DAO for Legal Issues. A DAO to fund DAO development. Obviously there is no way to limit these DAO's to these areas, however to remain smaller targets it would be easier to map investors to specific concepts. 
4. Structural separation of the Curation team. 
The absolute worst part of this failure is that TheDAO's marketing brought key members of the community into the firing line. Simply these people offered their time to support the DAO, and now their reputations have been tarnished. Instead we need to find a way to have trusted members of the community involved without risking them with exposure. Something like a separate contract with a list of wallets that a DAO can optionally reference. This problem needs to be resolved before the next DAO launch.
5. Lets test governance next time before the launch.  

So in my mind, the future looks like this:

Multiple smaller, more specific, constantly updating DAO's with multiple code bases. This lowers the threat surface, ensures that some of these DAO's are not susceptible to a given future exploit and creates a large group of moving targets. 

PS: There are 2 conditions in which I would consider the Ethereum project ""Dead"".

1. Failure to learn from mistakes.
2. Failure to take risk.

1955,ethereum,"A hard fork does not affect the ""immutability of contracts""","Immutability of contracts means code must perform as written and that the outcome of the contract call cannot produce non-deterministic results.  In the case of the DAO, the contract code was immutable, as expected, and this was precisely what allowed an individual to grossly distort the intended result of the contract. 

However, there is a second and unrelated rule that is inherent to all public blockchains that operate by community consensus: if the blockchain is being used in a way that violates the beliefs of a sufficiently large number of individuals, those individuals can take steps to change the blockchain.  This is a feature of all public consensus systems and even if one community decides not to use this feature, it always exists, nonetheless.   Therefore, anyone who believes that all PoW states on a public blockchain are ""immutable"" is seriously misinformed. 

Imagine a situation where a smart contract was being used such that a nuclear weapon would be triggered in a city based on the results of random number generator.  If the ethereum community decided to hardfork around the deployment of this contract, does this mean that ""ethereum is a shitcoin""?

* At what point will we know if a soft fork has achieved majority consensus?

* Technically speaking, will a 'soft fork' client just refuse to mine invalid transactions or will it actually ignore blocks containing invalid transactions (I assume the latter).

* Finally, a slightly more technical question, if a soft fork occurs, presumably it will initially be supported by very low hashing power, will this result in very large block times and if so what is the rate at which difficulty can adjust downwards (i.e. is it fast enough for this to not be a problem?).

1961,ethereum,Ethically being hacked,"Which do you think would be an ethical position regarding The DAO hack if you had an influential position over Ethereum?

It's out of my knowledge if the EVM could or should have prevented this exploit, but the attack vector was clearly and timely warned by devs.
That said, it seems here's consensus that the fault belongs to the DAO smart contract and not to Ethereum protocol.

Being a DAO funder myself, I could come to agree with a witch hunt or a hard fork to get the stolen funds back, but it seems this wasn't a zero day (insider) exploit nor an Ethereum bug. So rolling back would be like saying this ball is mine, that was not a goal and I'll go home with my ball. 
We have already seen that attitude on the cryptosphere and they obviously failed. 

If there's a way to get back or to lock the drained funds, I think that should be done by consensus from inside The DAO. That's why the DAO exists after all.

Would it be fair for Ethereum to take sides with one contract besides of another?

1971,ethereum,The custom blacklist feature is a terrible idea,"1. Blacklisting should not be left to be decided by a simple majority of miners. Blockchains are built on the implicit social contract that protocol changes rewriting ownerships will never be approved. I could see why one might want to make an exception for the DAO attack, but letting a threat of account freezing above *absolutely everybody else*'s head would be suicide for Ethereum. When people realize their assets aren't safe on Ethereum, they will just leave. Those who remain will have consensus, but at what price?
I don't think this is far fetched: for instance, if you freeze whales' funds, you only inconvenience a handful of people, but the rest actually benefit from the increased scarcity of ether. Of course, the price of ether may suffer, but do you trust miners to make the right call on your behalf, or would you rather migrate to another blockchain that has a history of categorically rejecting this kind of nonsense?

2. If you cannot be dissuaded from implementing custom blacklisting, at least miners should vote on-chain for what they prefer to freeze or not (using the extra data field), and miner nodes should enforce the result of that vote. They should not be given the freedom to mine against the consensus, as it only fragilizes the network. Especially if the list of blacklisted addresses grows, because any deviation from the consensus blacklist will result in mining on an orphaned chain and in a fragmentation of the hash power. This would make the blockchain insecure. In the current implementation, there is no way of knowing what the consensus will be *before* a fork happens, which will inevitably lead to a split of the hash power - at least temporarily - between the competing chains.

Overall, I think this soft fork is rushed. A software solution has been pushed without pausing to consider the implications of using it. Other issues include the problem of a soft fork without a hard fork, which would lock forever all of the ether still in legitimate DAOs (the original one and the legitimate splits). It worries me that many seem not to care about effectively stealing funds that are yet unstolen from their legitimate owners.",1466338364

1974,ethereum,Optics: How decentralized PR and lack of empathy may kill Ethereum,"I'm an odd bird in that during my 25+ year career I've been a programmer, founder, PR/marketing person, author, editor, and producer. I've been inside shit storms like this, accidentally caused one myself (took down west coast ISPs by accident in the 90's), and have witnessed many as a writer. 

There's a narrative that always plays out here, but you can mitigate the damage if you handle certain things well, but even more importantly you take precautions in the first place. So let me just put in $.02 on how this could have been avoided (with the assumption the exploit had still occurred) and what to do about it now.

First: Nepotism. If you look at the founding of Ethereum and the people involved and how after the successful crowdfunding, many of the founders went off from the not-for-profit to found for-profit companies running on Ethereum. In a way this is good because you eat your own dog food. However the mistake here is that they all had too close of ties to each other, serving on multiple boards and as advisers. 

This means that there was no distance between any of these parties and any catastrophic disaster. Vitalik himself, should only have served on the board of Ethereum and that's it. This avoids the appearance of conflicts of interest. 

Already, true or not, fingers are being pointed towards it being an inside job. Now the fact that the DAO ""advisory board"" was comprised of 11 people with direct/former ties to Ethereum, and the fact none of them were objective observers or someone who could serve to audit the rest...now tarnishes Ethereum. 

https://blog.slock.it/vitalik-buterin-gavin-wood-alex-van-de-sande-vlad-zamfir-announced-amongst-stellar-dao-curators-44be4d12dd6e#.1ciw2ake0

""In partnership with Daohub.org we were able to secure a set of DAO Curator signatories that reads like the Who’s Who of crypto. The Curator is composed of 11 members, all of which are current or former members of the Ethereum project, and all having had a direct hand in building the successful network that has now matured into Homestead.""
 
Now all their reputations are tarnished as well.

Because of all this, when the finger pointing begins in earnest, every single one of these people, their companies, their organizations, will be tied to this and may even be involved in lawsuits. That means a rehash in the media again and again and Vitalik can't say...I had nothing to do with this...because no one will believe it. 

Second: Hubris. Media loves the story of the underdog...and boy they really love the story of 19 year old nerd changes the world. You know what story they like better...22 year old nerd creates technology that loses $$$Millions of dollars. I'm not saying it is fair...I'm saying that's the story that runs if you don't have control over the narrative. 

And this story will run. Because step number 1 wasn't handle well, this in effect is the narrative that goes out. 

But besides the fact that people love to tear down their underdog...why will this happen? 

Few reasons. Let's start with Ethereum themselves. The successful crowdfund may have sealed its fate because it put a target on the project to live up to the hype, but then the hype machine started to self feed itself, as did Ethereum. The language used by many from the organization about changing the world...it infected the community with hope...and massive expectations. Frankly...everyone let it get a bit out of hand. 

Then the money got involved, because VCs are bored with what's out there in Unicorn land, they need a new exploit. Well how about all these blockchain startups? Now you have these ""sages"" telling the media about how this will fundamentally change everything and Uber will be dead because this will replace it...and then the community keeps taking these news stories and feeding them back into the community. Eventually you all raised Vitalik to Messiah status, which was unfair to do to a 20-something year old kid. He's a smart kid who needs a solid structure of guidance and people looking out for him...and so far it has been a lot of bad advice. 

I think a lot of people likely have taken advantage of someone who really does believe in changing the world for the better. 

But right now, what needs to happen is there needs to be someone who helps him and the rest of the community/companies with messaging. I see these technical posts which speak to the developer community, but I've not seen a single heartfelt contrition of...we're sorry. You don't have to admit you are responsible, but you can still apologize. 

Third: Not Controlling Expectations. Everyone got sooooo hyped up on the feel good patting of backs and look how clever we are, that no one for a second really thought to say...um...maybe we need to tamp down expectations a bit. Slow and steady wins the race...is a saying for a reason. Every media outlet is now going to find everything ever said about Ethereum or the DAO and serve it on a plate to force feed it back to the community. Let's just examine the front page of the Ethereum website:

""Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.""

So, applications that run exactly as programmed...no possibility of downtime...censorship...fraud...third party interference. That entire statement has now been proven false...well except for the ""exactly as programmed"" part which is damaging enough. 

The hype machine on this project (and blockchain) was so high, and this failure is so massive, it will have a chilling affect on all blockchain projects regardless of any link to Ethereum or the DAO. So it is important that Ethereum starts speaking with clarity and not simply to the developers, because right now there are millions of board room execs who were on the fence that just got pushed into ""I told you so"" and millions of others who supported blockchain who now have to eat crow. 

Fourth: So what to do? Well it may be too late but the first thing would have been for Vitalik and Ethereum to cut all ties to the DAO and make it CLEAR AS CRYSTAL...mistakes were made and we will learn form this...not just from a technical standpoint (which is the only thing I hear now) but from a business/social perspective. Since they all have direct ties to the DAO...hard to do for sure. 

Sword falling needs to occur. Slockit is fucked. Sorry, but their involvement, the hype they pushed, and their writing the code...plus their handling of the messaging (especially a certain someone) was just awful. These guys are going to be tearing at each other like rats in a bag. Vitalik and Ethereum can't be part of that. More importantly they need to show an act of contrition and they have to admit (true or not) it was them...they fucked up...and make sure it is clear Ethereum isn't to blame. 

And of course there's more I'd do like putting someone who is very empathetic and sympathetic as a voice for Ethereum...which is really Vinay Gupta. I know him and I like him and they need to push him out front to be a voice of compassion and reason...

There's more I'd do, but that's a start.

A few years into the future and we may look back to June 2016 and acknowledge that this was the right decision as part of the early stage teething problems of a new Ethereum ecosystem (we cannot expect that at the edge of evolution everything goes smooth at all times).

Let's assume we take the blockchain / ethereum maximum stance and do nothing...right after the Child Dao grace period is over and the 3MN+ ETH is out in the Ethereum ecosystem (eg secured from a hacker's perspective), the hacker will empty the next batch of The DAO wealth until it is empty. Each time, the community has the same choice to make...and the community will get increasingly nervous / scared. At the end, 15% of all ETH is in the hands of questionable stakeholders...then, I am pretty sure the PoS ambition will also be at risk...and Ethereum vision is truly at risk of folding.

In either case both soft and hard forks are a step away from an open network, to one moving towards censorship and potentially a path towards blacklists, etc. The architecture of the system grants miners this power, but by what standard they should use it remains undefined.

1989,ethereum,"Blockchains are NOT about ""code as contract"".","Ethereum has never been about ""code as law"".  Ethereum (and all blockchains) are about distributed CONSENSUS.  

Blockchains are simply a practical solution to the Byzantine General's Problem.  They solve that problem by allowing untrusting parties to still reach consensus on a state.  What they DON'T do, and never have and never will do, is prevent TRUSTING parties from coordinating to arrive at consensus.  When the majority of miners interests are so aligned that they can trust each other to act in a coordinated way for their mutual benefit, then whatever they agree to IS Nakamoto consensus.  This is not a bug, it's a built-in feature.  

The system is robust not because such miner ""collusion"" is impossible, but because game theory incentives (and disincentives) help ensure that collusion works to everyone's benefit:  If miners act too selfishly or irresponsibly, and to the detriment of the overall system and other stakeholders, the coins they mine or ""steal"" have diminished value, potentially approaching zero. Thus, miners are incentivized to reach consensus (that is, to ""collude"") only in such ways that they maximize the value of the coin.  In maximizing the value of the coin, they act in everyone's bests interests (holders, spenders, developers, etc.).  

Blockchains are not, never have been, and never will be immune from social pressures and ""social fixes"" to widely percieved problems.  Game theory ensures that.  Everyone crying about ""code as law"" misses this vital point.

 If we did move to PoS, the attackers could fire up a few mining rigs thanks to all the money they got from their shorts and have a huge amount of influence over the network, *forever*. 

I invested in something that was a risk and I knew that the possibility that my investment could go to 0 is not insignificant. I can accept my losses, I would even prefer to just burn all the ETH in the DAO and just write off the losses instead of forking, which would decrease supply, generally seen as a plus to the investment community. 

I think that a fork would also signal to institutional investors that the network can heal itself and come together as a community.

2001,ethereum,to the Community: Forking Is A Competitive Advantage for Ethereum，Don't Give Up,"This is a moment of reflection, on the very reason we invested and backed Ethereum since ICO. The DAO incident is no simple financial exploit, the attention of the Attacker is to hijack Ethereum development by implanting the very ideology that plagued and stalled the bitcoin development- Anti-forks, into the Etherland.

Let's not forget why we come to the Etherland in the first place, for me, the Ethereum resembles a much more ambitious vision and pragmatic dev team with the ball and determination to out innovate bitcoin. 

Much fortunate, our tolerance and ability to continuously fork is why we are able to claim 20% of bitcoin's marketcap in barely one year after launch and gain our position as The Other Coin. TheDAO has its lesson to learn and Ethereum as a beta system, should continue to live up to that very motto: Fail fast, Fail often. 

Fork haters, remember Homestead, it is a hard fork which shorten the block time from 17s to 14s, effectively introduced more inflation into the system, I didn’t hear much noise when we pushed forward with Homestead. Economically, isn’t the addition of almost 30% inflation tax over all ether holder a much worse economical consequence than DAO forks? Ye we marched ahead and we dealt with it well. 

Forks to get back DAO's money is not only morally just but also pragmatically necessary to nurture the Ethereum ecosystem. We don't like it but that's how a beta system evolve. The DAO isn't a regular VC fund, it is a fund specifically for funding projects within the Ethereum ecosystem. Most of the investors are the same people backing Ethereum and have long-term faith in Ethereum. Let them take hair cut because they don't do their due diligence is just ideological fundamentalism without sense of reality.  

People argue for no intervention. They ignore the fact that intervention is inevitable for a beta system at its infancy. Justification of such intervention is subject to community debate and ultimately mining consensus. Consider Ethereum as an intervention-free, fork-free system is childish. Try a thought experiment, in 2030, an AI implement a contract on Ethereum to launch all nuclear weapon to extinct humanity, will this event justify a contract invalidation hardfork? I think so. The DAO is a smaller problem in the context of humanity but its impact will be systematic to the ecosystem. 

If we don't fork the DAO fund back because of those silly libertarian claims, imagine the compounding effect of these out-of-touch ideological dipshit gathering up to Casper switch. 

We invest in Ethereum for all its distinction from bitcoin, engaging and united community, tolerance to forks, pragmatic and ambitious development team despite centralized, able to make quick iteration and decision v.s a divided bitcoin community with an ideological central development team and stalled development process. 

We invest in Ethereum to pursue a great vision and accomplish grand mission. I would rather back a DAO which may last only 6 months, than to back a divided house couldn’t even stand deciding the improvement from 1m to 2m for several years. 

The Attacker's success premises not on taking the ethers but implanting that inaction bitcoin anti-fork ideology, so this is not a fork-or-no-fork war but a war for a different path and different vision. I hope the community will once again prove that we will fork our way out of this deadlock and take our journey to the next level. 

Etherland is the New World, folks, let’s build it the new world way.

Its not hard to imagine 51% of the population who control an IP address (governments / my grandma / people who fear bitcoin / people jealous of early adopters etc voting to shut down bitcoin and other crypto currencies.

But yet that is what this soft fork in ethereum is implementing. A way for anyone to propose a patch to shut down / change any application on ethereum by 51% vote. Akin to an IP address vote to shut down and change a service on the internet.

Its ludacris and will eventually lead to no innovation on ethereum at all. Why would anyone build on a platform where if 51% of naieve/mainstream users are afraid of your idea or dont understand your idea they can just shut it down, sieze funds / change the code base etc.

This is the best analogy I can come up with to help those people that are saying ""this majority vote would be a feature of ethereum"" understand this concept better.

If the fork has to be done then so be it. But it is imperative that there is some form of guarantee that after we move into serenity or metropolis that there will be NO MORE application level forks. Only ever code base protocol level forks and that guarantee must be hard coded to maintain trust in running applications on the network.

2012,ethereum,Proposal of an on-chain solution to theDAO problem,"The DAO situation currently appears to me as follows: There are people (say: Alice) who have invested some amount of Ether (say: 1) in the DAO. Then there's the attacker (Bob) who has the only vote in a child DAO, to which soon all of this money will have been transferred.

The future is less clear: Either nothing happens and the attacker will be declared the rightful owner of the Ether. Or there will be some sort and/or combination of soft/hard forks, blacklisting, etc., which will mean that the funds are transferred back to Alice or that they will be frozen. In short there are three options: Alice 1, Bob 0; Alice 0, Bob 1; Alice 0, Bob 0; each with unknown probabilities, and no one, not even Bob, can be happy.

What I propose to Alice is this: Buy your 1 ETH back from Bob, for, e.g., 0.1 ETH. This is a win-win situation: Bob doesn't get all of the money, but he gets a lot of it even in case of a fork. Alice loses some money, but keeps most of it.

How can we do that in a trustless and fork-surviving way? Fortunately we are on a block chain! I suggest that the attacker submits and passes the following proposal to his child DAO: ""Send 1 Ether from the DAO to any Alice who can provide proof that she has sent 0.1 Ether to Bob.""

Summed up, in case of no fork, Alice gets 0.9 Ether, Bob gets 0.1. In case of a fork, Alice gets her 1 Ether back from the DAO, the transaction from the DAO is revoked, but the 0.1 Ether transaction from her to Bob is still valid. Blacklisting is in the interest of neither Alice nor Bob (Alice would lose, Bob would stay at 0.1 but he has next to no political power to enforce it anyway).

Maybe I'm naive, but this looks like a nice solution: No fork would be necessary, so no (or at least not as much) loss in reputation of Ethereum. A loss of only 10% for all Alices, which seems like not a lot for such a high risk investment. And still a lot of safe, clean money for Bob, and the good feeling of having taught a lesson to the community.

Not every one will trust the referendum smart contract even if the code is on github with documentation or maybe the UI will not work for everybody or maybe some users will feel like they are not confortable with smart contracts (interacting with smart contracts or maybe deploying smart contracts)

**In conclusion: Let's vote with our money. **

A referendum should be held on **Thursday, 23 June** for example (same day as the EU Referendum):

The users should do a transaction and send some Ether (any amount) from their wallet to a smart contract (any smart contract):

* send X.01, 03, 05, 07 or 09 ETH for Yes (Yes - I want a fork, and this is not about what type of fork it is) to any contract

* send Y.02, 04, 06 or 08 ETH for No (No - I don't want a fork and I want to 'stay' in the current chain) to any contract

You can create your own smart contract and code it to send the funds back or to a different address or speak to a friend so that you don't loose money. 

At the end of the day, we can look at the blockchain and count the votes or something and ignore the those trying to cheat the system (as in trying to send from 0x123 to 0xabc, getting the money back in the same address / different adress and repeat).

* Option 1: if fork: trust in ethereum as a fundamentally immutable ledger is destroyed, eth price goes down as a result, The DAO holders get 100% of ETHs back thanks to the ""bailout"" at reduced price. After a while ppl start to realize the ledger is still immutable (and ETHs outside smart contracts always safe) but funds in smart contracts are not guaranteed before a 27 day period because protocol may fork in the meantime under special circumstances judged by people (not by maths) and agreed by miner majorities. Such ""protective"" mechanism is understood as part of Ethereums way of working - based on math and highly automized, but surveilled by human judgement.

* Option 2: if no fork: it would imply that in the future ppl should only invest in smart contracts if they have better code reading capabilities than ethereum core devs themselfes to see all pitfalls in advance. because if they fail doing so, nobody will help them. As a result, smart contracts become de-facto unusable for practically everybody, the business model as such has failed because it requires participants to TRUST the contract programmers to write perfect backdoor-free code (which they can't) in the turing-complete ethereum language. So with this option TheDOA holders get back 70% of their ETHs at a largely reduced price.

Am I missing anything? I don't see what variant is better (less worse), but I have a tendency, which is contrary to what I had thought until yesterday.

After the 27 day period attacker may try to bribe miners into option 2 with TXs containing millions (usd) of tx fees. will be interesting to see whether they take that money and go for option 2 (of course because of the ideals of immutable ledger, not because of the TX fees ;) ).

A centralized platform, who's judgement was arbitrary, controlled by people with an emphasis on crowdfunding and primarily designed as a get rich quick scheme. I think I thought at the time that just by being a blockchain, Ethereum could never be like Intheoreum.
Now it seems like I was naive, I didn't realize just how fragile this could be.

If the Ethereum community is to learn from Bitcoin then it needs to understand something really important. Bitcoin serves the underserved. If you look at the majority of actual transactions using Bitcoin as a medium of exchange there can be no doubt that Bitcoin serves people who's economic activities would otherwise be censored, like the dark net markets. It doesn't serve people who already have bank accounts, or whose transactions can be processed by VISA. They might use bitcoin as a novelty but until bitcoin is the main currency of a nation, it serves no purpose for ordinary transactions. Most people, even in the bitcoin community, don't understand this, or they are in denial because they don't want to be associated with drugs.

I believe that for Ethereum to survive it must supply smart contract logic to the underserved. That means the network must not censor, no matter what happens. If Ethereum was being used to fund a paramilitary organization or create a governance structure for a death cult, we would still not censor it, because it's primary principle is to be a neutral medium. We believe that the overall benefit to humanity of having this neutral medium  outweighs the fact that it will definitely be used for things we don't like.

If we cannot agree on this one principle then I don't think this will survive long. You can guarantee that more bad things will happen on the network and that a majority of people will not like these things. If we ""patch"" every one of these things the network's reputation for cronyism and arbitrariness will ultimately destroy any value it has. This is in fact, exactly what the DAO attacker, it seems, would like to see happen.

As far as I can understand, the main argument against this boils down to ""But this is *really* bad."" or worse ""This negatively effects people who are really important in Ethereum."" or ""This is a beta their shouldn't be real consequences."" or ""If we don't do this then we loose the faith of the DAO token holders and the economic effect on the Ethereum network will be catastrophic. The DAO is too big too fail.""

I'm truly sorry for DAO investors and I hope they are able to remedy their losses by negotiating with their attacker or attacking them in return. But it doesn't matter that such an incredible amount of money and faith was placed in the DAO code, or that the bug was obscure, if that project is truly separate from the Ethereum network then the Ethereum network must be neutral.

If contract code is to have real gravity, there can be no do-overs. Otherwise Intheoreum is looking like a pretty good option and Ethereum is looking like an April fools joke.

Incidentally I slipped a piece of paper into Bob's cell to see what the Intheoreum consensus mechanism would do and it came back:

2040,ethereum,Debunking arguments against a hard fork,"Considering the fact that a hard fork will NOT affect previous unrelated    transactions or ""roll back time"", I'm surprised to see so much debate
going on as to whether we should go ahead with the fork.

Even more surprising, is how bad the arguments are by those who oppose the fork. I therefore made this list to debunk all the arguments made by those who for their 'purist ideological' reasons oppose returning over 40 million dollars worth of ether back to their rightful owners.
_________________________________________________________________
Argument 1:

Hard forking to save ether that was lost because of a badly written smart contract goes against the fundamental principle that smart contracts are immutable and that transactions on the network should 
be permanent and unchangeable.


Counter-argument:

Let's take a step back. What was the original purpose of such a principle? What value was it trying to bring? If you ask me, I believe the original purpose was to create a network of value where people can feel
that their money is secure and safe from third party influence such as
thieves and corruptible individuals and/or institutions. 

By letting the thief get away with the funds you are in fact breaking that very principle you are claiming to defend. If in the future, a bank 
wishes to incorporate a public blockchain for storing some of its reserves, which blockchain do you think it would choose? A blockchain that rewards hackers for stealing money, or a blockchain that can retrieve that money and return it to its rightful owner. I think the answer is obvious.
__________________________________________________________________
Argument 2:

If transactions can be reversed by the Ethereum community what stops transactions from being reversed for malicious purposes or governments putting pressure on the community to reverse transactions to ""criminals"" or donations to Wikileaks? Couldn't this lead to a slippery slope? 


Counter-argument:

What needs to be remembered here is that any change to Ethereum
HAS to have the full backing of the majority of the Ethereum community.
it's precisely for this reason that a malicious entity will have no chance of getting the majority to accept his version of the blockchain.

In order for any transaction to reversed, its reversal has to be in line
with the values of thousands of individuals and numerous miners and exchanges. It's my understanding that the government isn't part of this community and since the Ethereum community is global, no government, in particular, can have much influence on decisions such as forking. Regardless, the ability to reverse transactions by the community exists. Whether we choose to fork this time for this specific reason will not affect our ability to do it next time for another reason.  

Could forking this time lead to a slippery slope where we could end up forking the blockchain for ""bad"" reasons? I think the answer to that is entirely up to the community. As for now, considering how much controversy exists due to a proposal for forking the blockchain in order to foil a massive theft, I think any worries of a slippery slope are totally unfounded.

What should also be noted, is that Etheruam is still very young and new. if Etheruam goes mainstream, hard forking would be become a much harder thing to do. We are still in a learning process and we should take advantage of that.

Argument 3:

Investors in the DAO knew that they were taking a risk just like in any other investment. Why should we bail them out? They made a bad decision, they lost, end of story.    


Counter-argument:

First of all, they are not being ""bailed out"" the fork will return to them money that was rightfully theirs from the account of the thief. 
A ""bail out"" is when the money of a third party (e.g. taxpayers) is used to restore the loss of an individual or an institution. There is quite a difference.

Secondly, the idea that we should not retrieve the funds from the thief
because investors knew they were ""taking a risk"" is illogical and lacks moral clarity. If you open up a shop, and it gets robbed, do you let the thief get away because you ""knew the risk"" when you chose to start a business? The point is that investors didn't lose because of ""bad market predictions"", but lost because of a malicious actor who stole their money! Why on earth would we choose not to give the money back to the investors when it costs us absolutely nothing to do so?
__________________________________________________________________
Argument 4:

The DAO wasn't hacked! it was part of the contract. The lucky individual who ""read the fine print"" should be allowed to keep his reward! We should also thank him for teaching the community a valuable lesson on smart contract security!


Counter-argument:

next... 
__________________________________________________________________
Argument 5:

Hard forking to reverse a transaction would hurt Ethereum's reputation in the long run.


Counter-argument:

The complete opposite is true. Which of the following two headlines
would be better for Ethereum's long-term reputation? 

1) Mt. Gox 2.0 ""DAO"" smart contract hack leads to over 40 million dollars worth of ether being lost.

2) Ethereum community retrieves stolen ""DAO"" funds through blockchain ""hard fork"". All investor funds are safe.

I think it should be obvious to anyone that the latter case would be much better for Ethereum's long-term reputation. If we are trying to go mainstream, our community should be seen as a positive force that can fix a wrong when it occurs. Opposing a hard fork in order to please the ""crypto-purists"" would be a mistake, and would paint a bad picture of the Ethereum community.

2044,ethereum,Automated Reusable Miner Fork Voting,"So, we need a public way for the miners to vote about how to go about forking. They should have a voice, and it would be good for everyone else to be able to see the status of their consensus, including the miners understanding that between one another.

It's very likely that with a turing complete language being used to express contracts that more bugs will be found in other contracts later. So it would be a poor solution if we spent all this time working on consensus if we didn't have a way to repeat and automate the process of voting and making the software that performs such a fork reusable. 

We could probably use the same token system to establish another voting process to which every miner is associated a token in the size of their verifiable computational power. Then when they vote, not only would that vote be secured by blockchain technology, miner clients that observed the vote would perform the transaction(s) against which the vote is applied. In this case, expressing that transaction as a contract would imply that the blockchain fork, but in reality, we shouldn't have to fork the blockchain because that would require that anybody other than the transaction might have their transactions reversed. 

In addition, developing the rules of this system of revision and prevention would need some deeper consideration because we don't want to hand miners the power to award themselves more coins from arbitrary wallets. But if it's done right, we'd have a *reusable* system where people could just vote to reverse illegitimate transactions.

Tokens or other assets controlled by the contract could then be ""reversed"" at the will of a supermajority of miners.  This could be implemented with only a few lines of code, and added to any contract which *wants* to be ""hardforkable"", while leaving the rest of the contracts just the way they are.

This is a great idea. It will be like turning the entire ethereum network into a dao with proposals and votes. Except people will propose to change things they dont like about ethereum Dapps. 

Imagine if there was a political dapp but 51% of stakers dont agree with that form of politics, hey i know, lets sieze their funds and completely rewrite their code to have their funds directed to the political dapp that the 51% support. Sounds great!! Isnt that true democracy after all?

Well now I guess Dapps cant be called Dapps, they should be called Capps (consensus changable apps).

OK OK satire over..

But the real issue here, not doing the fork will destroy PoS and scaling aspirations. So do the fork.

But make it known to the world that after we are mature, after we enter serenity, there will be NO MORE application level forks! This grace period is granted to protect ethereum. But the grace period ends once we enter serenity.

Protocol level forks will be allowed of course. But application level forks will be over and people will need to survive on their own two feet instead of being babysitted by the devs. 

This rule to have no more application level forks needs to guaranteed through hard code to bring trust back into the network. To build a Dapp devs need to know that the stakers wont vote to change their Dapp one day in the future for whatever reason.

Pre-serenity: application level forks allowed to be submitted by Vitalik to prevent hacking, thefts and defend the integrity of the ethereum ecosystem.

2052,ethereum,Computability Classes and Ethereum,"Part of the misunderstanding that has taken place within the ethereum community is, I think, due in part to the attraction of having such a powerful contract language. But think it's been endowed with too much expressiveness. Recursion might not be strictly required, but with the way that most programmers typically think about computation, it's actually a feat to demonstrate that not only does a single program terminate, but that anything compilable in a typical programming language.

Developers of Coq have nailed this to a T though. Dependent typing and proofs might be too much, because there aren't that many programmers that are capable of authoring a proof. For that matter, just demonstrating that a transaction will terminate in a finite amount of time is probably sufficient. In typed languages, strong normalization is used to construct the language in such a way that it only admits function definitions for which there is a clear demonstration that the inductive operation is toward a sub-structure of itself. What exactly does that mean? For example, when you give a definition of an operation in Coq over peano integers, you are matching the next subsequent operation to one that either terminates, or to one for which the parameter of the encapsulating definition has been unwrapped. This is easy to see with peano arithmetic, since a number is either the successor of another number or it is zero; the compiler can see that operations terminate.

The other thing that needs to happen in this language, is even with a compiler enforced termination of functions, functions can be authored to have unacceptable complexity; or rather, that hackers might find a way to push that complexity to consume gas in their favor or increase the operational time in their favor. I think there is a need for a compiler derived cost per iteration, as well as enumeration of potential functions that are reachable from within the body of any other function. In this way, you can expose the same functionality used to limit and check contracts to developers such that they and everyone else can check what can happen.

2054,ethereum,I publicized the attack vector being used against TheDAO right now and have a bit more information,"There are a couple of things that don't seem to be widely understood in the posts I'm reading today, and I wanted to just get out a few bullet points which might help.

* Nothing requires that the creator of a split be the one to initiate this attack. Any participant in a split could be the one to make the recursive call. You could join a split a single block before the end, vote ""Yes"" on it, and execute this attack. You won't have the ability to whitelist proposals in the child DAO, of course. But, it's not a requirement to wait seven days for your own split to close out to do this attack. Off the top of my head, I don't remember if you get credited for the giant deposit or not in terms of number of tokens in the child DAO.
* There are two variants of this attack, a simple one, which does not involve swiping / sending out the DAO tokens at the end of the call stack, and a complex one which reuses the tokens. If you'd like to know whether a given attacker is going to be able to replay the attack, you should check the token transfers for the address initiating the splitDAO function. If tokens are moved out of their address, they will be available to reinitiate the attack. 
* The attacker mentioned there are other attacks. This looks to be true to me from reviewing the code. Some have worse characteristics than the current attacks. If anyone can get me in touch directly with slock.it, it would be much appreciated -- they have not responded to repeated attempts to reach out.

1. It will belitttle the whole ecosystem and ETH will never be taken seriously again. 
2. This will crash the price rendering ETH holders significant losses.
3. DAO holders will be rewarded with their funds back while ETH holders pay for their mistake on the markets.

Actually, DAO holders now OWE ETH holders the soft fork only. WHY? 
1. Because the soft fork will lock up the funds they lost and burning those ETH will go a little way to compensating ETH holders who did not invest in the DAO for losses they have ALREADY incurred on the markets.

2061,ethereum,Destroy the coins.,"tl;dr: I strongly believe that we should do a soft/hard fork that would destroy the coins currently present in The DAO, more precisely those that exited the Dao through that loophole.

The two main options I have read so far to deal with the DAO heist were:

1. Let's fork and get our coins back.
2. DAO investors just need to deal with their losses, a fork would destroy the confidence in Ethereum.

Being in the top 500 most invested in The Dao, it is painful for me to suggest that other option but **I believe those coins should be destroyed**.

I think it is fair that if the majority of the Ethereum community feels like if there's something/someone threatening the network as a whole, it is its duty to take the necessary steps to protect it. But by it, I specifically mean the network, not some individual participants such as myself.

This black hat hacker is indeed a treat to the network, particularly if we want to move forward with the Proof of Stake. The way he has acquired the coins is proof he wants to damage the network, that's a good enough reason for the network participants to activate the safety switch I believe.

But again, **this safety switch (fork) MUST be used in a way that only benefits the network as a whole**, not some individual participants. I feel a bit idiot to have invested that much without understanding exactly what I was getting into, for trusting someone rather than understanding the contract I was funding. It's my fault, I am willing to pay for it. It should be a lesson to us all.

I guess a positive side effect would be to reduce the quantity of Ether by about 10%, which should increase its value proportionally.

Now they’re in over their head and they’ve damaged the reputation of themselves, of ETH, and possibly crypto at large. It’s a dev team managing a hedge fund… what did we think would happen?

Don’t let a predictable botched execution get us down on one of the most incredible innovations and gifts to humanity (which we do owe to Slock.It).

**HARD FORK:**

**Pros:**

1. Makes DAO token holders whole.
2. Protects against the attacker having the largest stake after the switch to PoS.
3. Might help put potential mainstream users at ease.

**Cons:**

1. Will invite more ridicule from other crypto projects.
2. Undermines credibility of the Ethereum blockchain, which could translate into distrust from potential mainstream users as it filters out from the crypto community.
3. Might cause the greatest brain drain of the options, as a large number of prominent developers appear to be opposed to this option. (Citation needed.)
4. Will cause hardline softforkers and laissez-faire users to leave.


**SOFT FORK**

**Pros**

1. Protects against the attacker having the largest stake after the switch to PoS, as the attacker won't be able to access the ""lonely"" DAO ether.
2. Buys us more time, should we decide to take further action later on.
3. Might help put potential mainstream users at ease.

**Cons**

1. Invites ridicule from other crypto projects, though less than the hard fork would.
2. Undermines credibility of the Ethereum blockchain somewhat, since it demonstrates that censorship of contracts is indeed an option if enough pressure is brought to bear.
3. Will cause hardline hardforkers and laissez-faire users to leave.


**LAISSEZ-FAIRE**

**Pros**

1. Does the most to preserve the credibility of Ethereum as a censorship-free blockchain.
2. Invites the least amount of ridicule from other crypto projects.

**Cons**

1. Results in the attacker having a large amount of ether to stake with or dump as they see fit, which will be painful.
2. Moves mainstream adoption further out into the future as the ecosystem signals it requires more time to mature before it becomes safe for unsophisticated users.

**VARIATIONS**

**CHARITY + &lt;any of the above&gt;**

Any of the above options, plus a fund for interested persons and organizations to donate to make DAO token holders whole in exchange for karma/reputation/good feelings.

2076,ethereum,Minority game or the El Farol Bar problem - A small distraction from recent events.,"I wrote a small smart-contract that implements a variant of the minority game, played with ETH. The game is simple enough to be played in your Ethereum Wallet
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Farol_Bar_problem for details on the origin of the minority game.

The game is very simple:
You can bet any amount of ETH on Red or Blue, by executing the BetOnRed() or BetOnBlue() function.
The color with the least ETH wins.
Every bet on that color is paid back double.

The betting period lasts for 480 blocks (approximately 2 hours). After that you can claim your reward by executing the Payout() function.

All bets trigger events that show the current totals for Red and Blue, as well as the remaining number of blocks. Just check the ""Watch contract events"" checkbox. The last bet will trigger a ""Finished"" event. After the ""Finished"" event you can call the Payout() function.

The sourcecode and other details are available on: https://live.ether.camp/account/38118c5ab0cc580678797b975b877e937310bd8c

If you want to play click on ""Contracts-&gt;Watch contract"" in your wallet. You will need this information:
Adress: 0x38118C5ab0cC580678797b975B877E937310bd8C,
JSON Interface: [ { ""constant"": false, ""inputs"": [], ""name"": ""BetOnBlue"", ""outputs"": [], ""type"": ""function"" }, { ""constant"": false, ""inputs"": [], ""name"": ""Payout"", ""outputs"": [], ""type"": ""function"" }, { ""constant"": false, ""inputs"": [], ""name"": ""BetOnRed"", ""outputs"": [], ""type"": ""function"" }, { ""inputs"": [], ""type"": ""constructor"" }, { ""anonymous"": false, ""inputs"": [], ""name"": ""Deployed"", ""type"": ""event"" }, { ""anonymous"": false, ""inputs"": [ { ""indexed"": false, ""name"": ""Red"", ""type"": ""uint256"" }, { ""indexed"": false, ""name"": ""Blue"", ""type"": ""uint256"" }, { ""indexed"": false, ""name"": ""RemainingBlocks"", ""type"": ""uint256"" } ], ""name"": ""Score"", ""type"": ""event"" }, { ""anonymous"": false, ""inputs"": [ { ""indexed"": false, ""name"": ""Red"", ""type"": ""uint256"" }, { ""indexed"": false, ""name"": ""Blue"", ""type"": ""uint256"" }, { ""indexed"": false, ""name"": ""Winner"", ""type"": ""uint8"" } ], ""name"": ""Finished"", ""type"": ""event"" }, { ""anonymous"": false, ""inputs"": [], ""name"": ""Destructed"", ""type"": ""event"" } ]

Technical notes:
The first bet will start the betting period. The first bet that is processed after the time runs out will start the claiming period. Please call the payout function within approximately 48 hours (11520 blocks) after the game ended. To avoid polluting the blockchain, the contract is destroyed after every winner has claimed his reward or after 48 hours.

2078,ethereum,when is HF justified and when is it not justified?,"Can we have some sort of definition for when forking the network ought to be justified and when it shouldn't?

What ought the criteria be to decide when an HF is justified and when it's not justified? Until now the only purpose has been for upgrades and code changes. Now it seems that people are arguing it should also be to change mistakes caused by bad code in smart contracts that cause unintended financial loss to large numbers of people. Anything else it should include? Prevention of crimes, etc. and how large must these issues be and how many people must they effect? For example, if 90% of all eth was in the DAO, i think all would support HF. So it seems like it's only a matter of degree and what is in the best long term interest of the overall network. Some say: ""HF should be used to improve the network and usability only. Never to target specific users or addresses."" But these very people would likely concede that some situations would arise beyond just network and usability which would justify HF. Meanwhile the other group in support of HF here says HF should be allowed to fix mistakes that hurt people - and the bar to determine whether the HF should be allowed depends simply on whether enough consensus exists among miners to do it - and that this may change on a case by case basis.

2087,ethereum,[Warning] The Soft Fork Must Be Quickly Followed By Hard Fork Or 100% Innocent Pre-Hack Arbitrage Splitters Will Be Hurt,"From the end of the creation period until the hack, TheDAO tokens sold for about 90-95 DAO/ETH, a discount compared to the par value recoverable from an honest split. Many traders bought DAO tokens and played 100% by the rules and executed an arbitrage split where they took on the time-value risk of the time period for a split in order to recovery 100 DAO/ETH from a split.  Many of these splits were executed before the DAO hack, and their child DAOs have 100:1 ETH holdings. These transactions were legitimate and fair, the traders played by the rules exactly as stated in the code, and they did not exploit the recursive call bug. The money from these legitimate splits is locked up in child DAOs just as the hacked child DAO (multiple at this point, I count three instances of the hack having occurred to date). 

The currently proposed soft fork will essentially blacklist all child DAOs, not just the hacker's. This will bar all of the legitimate child DAOs from withdrawing their ETH on schedule, under the proper terms of the DAO. This seems problematic for many reasons -- it sacrifices the majority for the innocent minority as currently framed unless something mitigates this harm. 

There is a number of legitimate splitters, who are completely innocent in this. They split before the hack, and so wouldn't have taken any loss from it. They played 100% by the rules as everyone understood them. These people will be hurt if we freeze all child DAOs through a majority vote. There is a saying in the law: It is better to let 10 guilty men go free, than to incorrectly jail an single innocent man. This is why guilt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt in criminal courts in the US and not simply by a preponderance of the evidence. It is simply untenable to sacrifice the minority for the majority benefit. 

Because I think this problem will be very problematic and will bother many people, the only way (under the currently proposed soft fork) to not allow innocents to be harmed is to then immediately hard fork and allow the withdrawal of all of the DAO's ether at 100:1 DAO/ETH.  Delaying the hard fork after the soft fork will sacrifice those innocent splitters, and if ETH crashes in the interim time while we fight over the hard fork, they'll be unfairly harmed. 

This is not meant to weigh in on whether we should soft fork or hard fork, just making sure people understand the issues fully. 

Edit: This does not only apply to arbitrage splitters obviously. Anyone who legitimately disagreed with the DAO could have been among the legitimate splitters. ",1466359812

It is thus clear that there are inherent risks.

2115,ethereum,Solidity DApp Audits,"Hi guys,

let me get right to the point: There is almost no marketplace for Dapps or smart contracts, and when there is, there is hardly a way to validate contracts. Even when contracts are made official by the author (which is luckily the case most of the time), seldom people are happy to read the full source. Not even talking about understanding what they read. All what happens is contracts are compiled and the EVM is compared to what is running in the blockchain - which is not telling you if the contract is sound or not.

As author of some solidity contracts I would be happy to have a few more eyes going through my source before it gets published. Also, I have yet to find a great testing facility... unit tests - nope, ... Testing via browser solidity doesn't even work most of the time either. And setting up my test-chain was horrid. Maybe that changed, I don't know. Don't understand me wrong, I love the ""wild west"" feeling, but I think we can do so much better than that. There are actually a lot of people in the community who have a thorough knowledge of solidity already.

I was thinking of a platform that brings the two together. Authors and ""Auditors"" - or at least people who are happy to invest time, read the code, give comments, all for a bounty, of course. 

I have started outlining and almost started implementing a MVP, but first I want to know from the community that just got hit hard by not having a few more eyes on the source of the DAO before it got released: Is there anything like that in the pipe yet?

2120,ethereum,We need to chat...,"So, do you know what the concept of a ""smart contract"" is? Do you what makes a smart contract different from other types of contracts? 

First, make sure you can answer the above questions. I am happy to help if you need it. Once you are satisfied that you understand the answers to the above questions, you can proceed...

Do you know that Ethereum's entire purpose is to execute smart contracts faithfully, explicitly executing the code as written? Do you know that this is the one and only role it is designed to fill?

Make sure that you can answer those questions, too. Go read the Ethereum whitepaper if you need to. It's important that you understand this fact, too, otherwise you won't be able to appreciate where this leads...

Once you're satisfied that you understand smart contracts and the fact that Ethereum is built solely to execute such contracts, objectively and without bias, you are finally ready to get the point...

*If* TheDAO is bailed out, *it wholly and irrefutably defeats the entire point of Ethereum*. It demonstrates that Ethereum, at least in extreme circumstances, is **not** a faithful smart contract execution platform. It is not immutable. There are loopholes for when things don't go as planned, and this is going to happen, because bugs are evidently pretty easy to miss.

Right now, a valid contract is in the process of being invalidated retroactively by a central agency's intervention.

Every conceivable value to Ethereum is fundamentally undermined by this single demonstration. It is showing, right now, that the overlords and community are much more interested in propping up the price of the token (the permanently-inflationary token that was explicitly *not* designed to be optimal from a monetary view) than actually adhering to the Ethereum vision. 


[Read these chat logs](http://pastebin.com/aMKwQcHR) where the Ethereum Foundation is frantically trying to get every exchange to halt *all crypto trading, deposits, and withdrawals* so that they could keep Ethereum from collapsing. The desperation is palpable. Ethereum has undeniably shifted into the ""Pump N Dump Shitcoin"" category at this point; whatever problems it was originally built to solve have been abandoned out of short-term, short-sighted greed.

In the case of Bitcoin, greed is carefully taken into account, and it serves as a propellant force to the growth and adoption of the network. In Ethereum, it is objectively preventing the system from doing what it was built to do. No matter how ""cool"" you think it is to be able to retroactively invalidate a ""smart"" contract if the community demands and/or it is otherwise coerced into happening, there is no way to deny that this is directly at odds with the point of doing things with smart contracts in the first place. If we just want to have a rule-by-mob or rule-by-central-agency contract execution platform, there are much simpler, much more cost-efficient, much more secure, and much more reliable ways we can achieve it. Again, the whole entire purpose of Ethereum was to make an inviolate Virtual Machine that follows programmatic contracts to the letter, without possibility of interference, and it was engineered with this purpose in mind. Many tradeoffs were made to achieve this (and personally I believe many poor design decisions were made on top of this, but that's not relevant to the point here), but up until now it looked like it might at least do what it purports to... maybe not efficiently or practically, but at least objectively. Now that this principle is being abandoned (despite the whole ""this is our one and only 'get out of jail free' card, guys, we totally promise!""), there's no actual reason at all for Ethereum to exist, other than as a speculative toy. A pretty bad long-term investment, too, considering the non-competitive infinite inflation. Basically, at this point Ethereum is a giant game of Hot Potato. You want to find the Greater Fool and sell him all your ether, because the token itself is now firmly in the ""shitcoin"" category after the whole DAO fiasco.

So, yeah. Ethereum is a private company running a quasi-blockchain, which is basically just a really expensive, not-very-powerful, and really error-prone Virtual Machine that fails to demonstrate objectivity in execution or immutability of state changes.

If its inflation based then i have some ideas:
Light solutions:
Get youtube to let people tip content creators with Doge Coins ( increase demand )

Get Steam to accept Dogecoins ( increase demand. Theres already a post about it on this site. Even one on change.org ) 

Heavy solutions:
Make sites that exchange Doges for money destroy the coins they get and compensate them with money or another cryptocurrency. ( decrease available coins )

Destroy the doge mining community ( i dont want this either but technically bringing the production of coins to a halt would stop the inflation. Its an option but one that no one wants ).

That would mean that with those tokens it would be possible to split from the split and drain again all ETH and finally return all ETH (with the help of miners that would exclude conflicting tx (censorship/ aka. soft fork).

The steps would be:

* Curators need to whitelist the ""darkDAO"".
* Curators should probably lower quorum
* a proposal must be made and passed to invest into the ""darkDAO""
* with the tokens in the ""darkDAO"" another split/drain attack will be performed
* counter activity of the hacker needs to be censored - that would effectively mean - censor all tx except from a whitelisted address that is in controll of a big alliance to recover funds (foundation, curators, slock.it, ...)
* finally in the split-split DAO a proposal could be made to send ETH back

**EDIT:**
For context - so far (to my knowledge) the common believe has been that only a hard fork could recover all funds. A soft fork (might) be easier to agree on because it is enough to convince the miners.

**Edit2:**
For more context - the important news is that we still can enter the ""darkDAO"".

- Simple quick fix
- Don't end up spending months debating this and wasting our time
- SEC doesn't investigate everyone involved
- Price doesn't crash because ethereum under SEC involvement and traders are afraid of dump from attacker
- $150 Million dollars are returned to ethereum evangelists who will reinvest and be even more motivated to make ethereum succeed
- DAO token holders are happy and get what's rightfully theirs
- The black hat attacker doesn't end up owning 5-15% of all ethers potentially threatening any POS upgrade possibilities
- All the DAO buyers and token holders don't get screwed over
- The community doesn't split into pieces and people don't hate each other, and instead becomes a force to reckon with as people realize we've tackled a problem way bigger than the block size debate in record time
- Media starts spinning this as a good thing and people don't remember Ethereum as that platform that got hacked
- We will not be known as Mtgox 2.0
- The wider world discovers that unlike any crypto before ethereum was able to thwart an attack and recover from a huge potential disaster
- This whole event becomes a huge lesson and a blessing in disguise as traditional financial institutions aren't afraid of hackers stealing their money on Ethereum, and the media exposure brings massive attention
- Ether price sky rockets to $100

There is immense value in ANY reduction in centralization from the shitshow that was 2008. To think otherwise is foolish. Anything that slides the scale over towards Decentralization possesses ""value.""

However, a second point that I wanted to make that I think pretty much EVERYONE has failed to notice is that centralization is required to create a decentralized platform. They don't just pop up and appear out of thin air. SOMEONE has to create. It's what happens after it's ""finished"" that matters. A simple analogy is a rocketship in space. Once it's in space it can float freely of its own accord, but it takes an extraordinary amount of fuel/propulsion/whatever to propel it INTO outer space. We are NOT in outer space yet. If these antics were to happen in the future, I'll be the first one to say ""fuck this shit.""

But most of you have no clue what the future path of the Ethereum foundation is. There are plans in place to strip it of its power and further decentralize it once the project has been completed. I bet most of you didn't know that.

If we can vote by majority rule, and the 'community' gets to decide, then I want to Tax the 1% who own 50% of Ether. 

I want a Fork to Share the Wealth around. Why should first movers get an advantage? I want a fork to spread that Millions of Ether in the top 50 Accounts to everyone equally. I think we can get a majority and a 51% consensus on that. If Consensus is the Law, and not the code, then I see nothing wrong with this, Right?

All the arguments being made in favor of doing this current fork apply here as well.

1) When we move to POS, this is a bad thing to have so much Staking power in a few hands. They shouldn't be the ones raking it in forever.

2) The Majority rules, Idealogies shouldn't get in the way of us getting what we need, Ethics be damned.  Lets be pragmatic, how could it be good for that top 1% to have all that wealth...etc.

In conclusion:

We need to Tax the 1% so the rest of us can share that wealth. Nothing wrong with this according to the moral theory they themselves are encouraging, so they have nothing to complain about. In fact, I don't think those people have any right to that money, Consensus is the law, that is the moral theory being put forward here, and we should use it to make sure no one has an unfair advantage just because they happened to be around when this thing started. We just need someone to create the Software and I'll start mining on it right now.   /s In case you missed it, but in reality I think if they set the precedent than ""What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.""

2182,ethereum,Why majority vote by hash power isn't a good way to determine whether to fork or not,"If someone has invested 500k in the DAO, they want the fork in order to recoup the investment. In order to increase the likelyhood that the fork will happen, they go out and buy hashing power in order to increase the amount of hashing power on the fork chain. They could spend 300k in hashing power which would buy them an additional x% of the total hashing power of the network. They thus increase the chances that a fork will happen because they have financial incentive to do so. Those who never invested in the DAO and don't have a vested interest in it, won't have the same incentive to buy mining power to hash on the non fork chain. This skews the relative proportion of the miners in favor of those that want to fork, thus increasing the likelyhood that a fork will happen based solely on people having a vested interest in it. One could think of a situation where paying off miners to vote in favor of the fork could be combatted by the attacker paying off miners to do the opposite. ",1466384252

2184,ethereum,Comparing the ethereum forks to Apple's refusal to unlock the terrorist iPhone,"It wasn't that long ago that Apple was embroiled in a battle with the FBI in which Apple refused to write code to decrypt the contents of the iPhone of the San Bernardino terrorist, Syed Farook.

Apple's argument was that by writing the software to decrypt an iPhone it would unleash a danger that could be used against all of its customers.  The letter is at http://www.apple.com/customer-letter/ .  Before you proceed reading this post, think of where you stood on this issue.

The proposed soft and hard forks for Ethereum are at least as bad as or worse than what the FBI wanted Apple to do.  

The code of the soft fork, already of which two candidates have been made public, shows how to easily freeze funds permanently.  It is incredibly trivial to change the blocked address or to make it an array of nearly countless addresses.  

No details of code have been released about the hard fork, but for it to work, it will be necessary that the Ether that now sits at the attacker's address will be able to be moved without the use of the private keys for that address.  Frankly, when that code is written and released, it will be like setting off an atom bomb on ethereum.  As soon as code is developed that can move ether or tokens from a public address without the private keys, there is no security at all.  

A blockchain is an immutable history of blocks, each one securely added to the prior block with a hash pointer.  If even one bit is changed in any preceding block, the hash pointers will not match and the chain will fall apart, at the point where the bit was changed.  

Transactions in crypto currencies are made valid by checking to see that a signature on that transaction was made by someone who had the private keys.  I don't understand how in fact a hard fork is going to bypass that.  It seems to me that only issuing new Ether can be done with a special coinbase transaction like a pre-mine transaction to the parent DAO.  

Nonetheless, Apple had the integrity to refuse to help the good guys to unlock the phone of a bad guy (a guy much worse than the DAO hacker) on the principle that they did not want to create software that could violate rights.  

The Ethereum community seems to be racing to do the opposite of what Apple did - to break every aspect of its cryptography and integrity for the sake of one fix.

We saw how a transfer of fragility from individuals to species is necessary for its overall survival: species are potentially antifragile, given that DNA is information, but members of the species are perishable, hence ready to sacrifice and in reality designed to do so for the benefit of the collective.

Antifragility shmantifragility.

2216,ethereum,"Ultimately, the winning smart contract platform will have certain ""social"" features that real-world contracts have.","In the real world, after hundreds of years and millions of written contracts in developed countries, there is an understood social contract executed by the justice system that does not allow a party to a signed contract to have property expropriated from him/her if it is thought to clearly not be the intent of the contract's signer.  

If I click on ""accept all terms and conditions"" on an iTunes software upgrade, if there is language in there, either on the first page or 50th page, that says I agree for Apple to take 1/3 of my net worth, no court will side with Apple.  That would be an evil system and completely socially unacceptable--so that contract would not be ""immutable.""  And importantly, it would not be a better legal system if that contract were immutable.  So after hundreds of years, the contractual system has evolved to where it is--where some contracts are not immutable--because that is the best system.  If there was a better way, society and the justice system would have spoken and we would have a different system.

I believe the future of smart contracts will have a similar feature.  Why?  Because whether it's a recursive call or some other bug, the big idea is that mistakes will always be made at some point.  This is unavoidable.  The ultimate winning smart contract platform will not tolerate what happened to the DAO.  Whatever system accepts what happened, whether it's Ethereum or some other platform, ultimately it will die and another system will win--one that has the same understood social contract that exists in the real world.  Mechanisms will ultimately be put in place to bring about such a system.

Soon, the current DAO matter will come to a conclusion.  One thing of which I am sure:  if the result is that the DAO investors will lose 32% (or more) of their money because of an obscure bug that even many experienced programmers missed, clearly something the investors had not intended and never would have agreed to, then Ethereum seriously damages itself and opens the door to a competitor that will have a socially correct solution to such a mishap.  On the other hand, if the stolen money is returned, and Ethereum comes up with and implements robust solutions to what will be a feature of smart contracts, then I think Ethereum will keep its lead as the smart contract platform and grow.

But they should've seen all of the rest of the red flags.

Bitcoin works because miners keep it working. Miners keep it working because they are motivated (financially) to do so. It is more economically beneficial to play by the rules of the system than to try to break them. It is more economically beneficial to keep the chain honest and going, than it is to fight it.

The DAO had none of that. None.

It only incentivised people to game the system. Look at my comment history, I said this months ago. 

We are seeing what happens when people forget proper incentive structures. The DAO should've, could've forseen many of these issues. If it wasn't this hack, it would've been a series of smaller malicious attacks designed to drain The DAO of it's funds. 

People need to understand this.

A smart contract will only work, if people are incentivized to keep it working, and keeping it working outweighs the incentives to break it. ",1466398495

Forks would've been entirely off the table, funds would've been redistributed to the rightful owners. Ethereum would've just continued it's path, learning from its mistakes and we could've all moved on.

But the attacker is not an ethical hacker. It's a psychopath, someone who never cared about ethereum and is carefully planning his next moves solely looking at which move will do the most harm to Ethereum.

The forking debate is not about how to save the DAO investors. This is about how we can and must protect Ethereum from an attacker that's actively trying to burn Ethereum to the ground with everything he has got.

We must take down the power of this psychopath with everything we've got in order to protect Ethereum from this looney. 

This isn't about saving a contract or saving investors, nor is any of this going to set a precedent. This is about stopping an attacker that's trying to destroy Ethereum.

This is war and in wars you can not defeat the enemy by holding up your principles high. When confronted with an enemy that doesn't care about your existence, an enemy that only wants your destruction, you must disable him with everything you've got.

2239,ethereum,Common misconceptions of forking blockchains,"**TL;DR** *There are some misconceptions about forking out there. Here are some information about soft and hard forks and what they mean in the context of the dao attack.*

The past two days I have read a lot of reddit posts, comments, blog posts and media article regarding whether one should (soft and/or hard) fork or not as a reaction to the dao attack.

I have noticed that there are many common misconceptions on what a soft/hard fork is, what these forks mean and how the process of forking looks like.

In my opinion it is essential to clear up these misunderstandings in order to give every community member the best possibility to form a profound opinion and have a fruitful and action-oriented discourse.

**Definitions of soft and hard forks**

I assume that this post is most important for community members without technical background therefore I keep the following defintions simple:

*Soft fork*: A soft fork is a change in the protocol (set of rules) in a way that some previous valid transactions/blocks are no longer valid. Since everyone following the old rule set will recognise the new blocks as valid, a softfork is backward-compatible.

*Hard fork*: A hard fork is a change in the protocol (set of rules) in a way that some previous invalid transactions/blocks are valid after the change.

**So how could the forks regarding the dao attack look like?**

*Soft fork*: The doa attacker drained part of theDAO's fund in a child dao which is a new theDAO contract. Each dao contract has the same hash. A possible soft fork could disallow value transaction from contracts with these specific hash. The ether would be locked and can't be transfered anylonger.

*Hard fork*: In a hard fork all rule changes are possible. A hard fork would be required for getting the ether drained in the child dao back in the mother dao contract. This could be done be reverting all illegimate splits. Then one could deploy [this contract](https://github.com/ethcore/withdraw-dao/blob/master/withdraw-dao.sol) and set the rule to forward every interaction of the mother dao to this new DAO which only functionality is to withdraw.

**Other common misconceptions:**

***A hard fork means there will be a rollback and the Ether I just bought will vanish.***

As I said before, in a hard fork all rule changes are possible and in principle even rollbacks. Nevertheless a rollback -a reversion of all transaction to a specific block- is absolutely unlikely to get community consensus and surely not indispensable in hard forks.
Hard forks which might be proposed will only revert specific transaction if any (e.g.illegimate splits).

***In a fork situation the miners decide which chain will ""win"".***

One could say that in order to have a successful and reliable soft fork (eg. the dao attack soft fork) a coordination of miner would be helpful but in general soft and hard forking is much more community consensus. 

Ethereum is much more flexible in adjusting the difficulty than Bitcoin. In Bitcoin it would result in a disaster if a large portion of miners decide to go along with the other chain than the rest of the community since the block time would increase enormously on the commonly used chain. Therefore forks in Bitcoin are prevoted by the miners - and yes in Bitcoin one can argue it is miner's choice. In Ethereum that's not the case. 

In a fork scenario a client version with the fork and one without it is released. Then each community member decides which branch to go along simply by using one chain eg sending transaction, trading coins and running contracts/dapps with or without the forked client version. Exchanges most likely follow the demand of the community members.
Under the assumption that a miner is a buisness man, miners therefore choose the chain to mine on which they earn most.

Miners choose the chain n where X(n)=(Hashrate/TotalHashrate(n))*CoinValue(n) is maximum. As you can see miners decision depends on the CoinValue of each chain which depends highly on the community decision.


***Forking is an evil thing and should be avoided under every circumstances.***

**In my opinion** forking the protocol of a blockchain has 3 purposes:

1) Keep the consensus system alive.

Forks are needed for bug fixing or are used to disincentivize attacks game theoretically.

2) Improve the consensus system.

Forks provide the possibility to add functionality or improve certain aspects of the consensus system.

3) Set and redefine the moral framework the consensus system runs in.

In my opinion forking is the purest form of social consensus. People come together in order to discuss, negatiate and finally form an agreement or build a new rule set. This can be done for fixing an previous agreement or for improving the capability of the previous agreement. Furthermore it can redefine or extends the morality of the previous agreement.
Ethereum is a consensus system where 'code is law'. It is a system which is build for human interaction (at least it is a tool for humans) but, nevertheless, it lacks of empathy. IMHO it is the duty of its community to take care of the system and check once in a while if the moral framework has to be adjusted.

So another important purpose of forks is to adjust the moral framework the consenus system runs in.

I dont think forking is evil. It is an indispensable tool.

To illustrate the idea of this moral framework, I posted a thought experiment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4oxhgj/purposes_of_forking_and_the_morality_of_consensus/). Check it out and discuss about how the moral framework of Ethereum should look like.",1466405838

I know there are some idealists for whom the principles of immutability, censorship resistence and no third party interference is the Holy Grail. I can identify myself with it BUT in a given reasonable moral framework.


**In order to illustrate it here is a little thought experiment:**

Imagine there is a smart contract which can be used to

A) conduct a crime like theft or fraud. 

B) conduct murder. 

C) activate a mass destruction weapon. 

D) activate a mass destruction weapon killing all living beings. 


Ask yourself for every situation: Should we take care of the moral framework our consensus system? Before or after the crime takes place? Which actions you propose?
At some point you say most likely 'we have to take care' (hopefully - otherwise you are very likely a psychopath).

2273,ethereum,Ethereum still has a bright future. Let's learn from this experience.,"I've been involved in cryptocurrencies for many years as a miner, investor, etc and have seen many turbulent times (all of the worst). The multiple large thefts of bitcoin, the MtGox crash, forks, etc. In every case, lessons were learned by each the miners, service providers and general user community. While events like TheDAO exploit are painful ones, there are important lessons to be learned. Newcomers may have a tendency to panic and dump their coins, but the cooler heads usually prevail and come out on top. In fact, even profit off of those who panic sell, knowing the price drops are not rational but rather emotional.

We watched Ethereum drop from a $2 billion market cap to a $1 billion market cap over a flaw in something which had nothing to do with flaws in Ethereum itself. All of this because of some unproven code that people gambled $100 million on. Sure, I want TheDAO to work just as much as the next guy, but let's accept what has happened and not repeat that mistake again.

I realize there are good arguments on both sides of TheDAO / fork debate, but let's make sure we learn from this and grow. Failure is ok, that's how humanity advances. But with failure, pay attention to the lessons:
* Don't gamble more than you are willing to lose. If you don't understand the technology (intimately) then you're simply gambling on faith (in devs, in advisors, in technology, etc). Accept it or not, but don't complain if you get burned knowing that you did not have full understanding going in.
* Don't get caught up in hype and illusions of getting rich quick.
* Don't panic on negative news. Consider the possible ramifications of the event and then decide if you should hold, buy or sell. Sometimes it's counter-intuitive and the opposite action is actually your best move. Ask yourself both why and why not before acting. Weigh both sides.

Ethereum wasn't the first cryptocurrency and likely won't be the last. This experience was a good thing in many ways. Better it happened now than later when it's more mature with a bigger audience. Imagine the news headlines if this happened in Bitcoin. We are still in the pioneer phase of Ethereum; the early adopters and risk takers.

In my mind, Ethereum is heavily undervalued at the moment. A $3 million leak (?) caused a $1 billion dollar market cap drop, largely due to panic. If anything, Ethereum is amazing simply for it's fast transaction times alone.

So stay confident as the technology is still sound. Whatever the developers decide to do (fork or not) we will look back and grow from this experience into a more mature platform. I am as excited about Ethereum as I was about bitcoin 6 years ago. Hopefully I am not alone.",1466413752

2275,ethereum,Yet another take on DAO issue.,"Facts:

- Something harmful for Ethereum has happened. You can argue that theft was not theft but it does not make it any less harmful.

- The rules of the system are defined by users. Users are miners, application developers, exchanges, end users of the applications and so on.

- If users think that there is something in the rules which could improve the system, they can do it collectively. The possibility of rule changes has always been in the system and anybody using ethereum should understand that. Rules have already been changed successfully, and they must be changed in the near future (difficulty bomb)

- Nothing in those rules is sacred. You can add ethers to circulation, you can destroy ethers from anybody, you can do anything as long as the users agree to that.

Opinions:	  

- People who oppose rule changes based on argument ""It would destroy the trust to the system immutability"" are wrong. It is basically saying: ""We can change the rules but we must not because if we did, people would think that we can change the rules which we can, but people must not understand that."" People who don't like the changed rules, can continue in the ""immutable"" chain.

- Rule changes (forks, hard and soft) are not harmful and should not be feared. Forks are one of the strengths of the Ethereum system and make it possible for system to evolve to the direction where people want it to go.

- Thief and the supporters of the thief can continue to use the system with current rules. Supporters of rule changes can fork and start to use that system. It is possible but quite unlikely that both systems continue to exist. And it would be as good situation as any other. Applications currently on chain would continue to work as intended in both chains, they are unstoppable as long as there is enough support with users. Yes, the value of ether and ether2 would most likely tank, but the value of ether is not the point of ethereum, applications are.

- I want to repeat: Users define the rules of system. Not miners, not ether holders, not developers, but all of them together. Miners can mine any fork they want to, but if the other users refuse to use that fork, there will be (new) miners who mine the fork users want. 

- We can cure bitcoin from fear of forks by showing it can be done even without 95 % majority :)

Someone (Mostly referred to as the Attacker) found a loophole in the contractcode of the DAO He discovered to get a bit more money when you try to split your DAO coins from the company. He exploited this loophole by performing this thousands of times so he acquired a significant amount of ETH.

TL:DR: Somebody did rob the soda machine by doing the coin-attached-to-a-tread trick.

**Was the DAO hacked?**

No he preformed this attack by finding an loophole on a contract rule. Was he did was totally inline according to the contract. The developers just missed this loophole. Which frequently happens in real life too, In the crypto world they happen to be very costly.

**How much money was stolen?**

At this moment **0 $**

There is a safety rule inside that says that when you split your DAO coins you have to wait for 27 Days. The attackers stolen ETH where transferred in a special account which is in this waiting line at this moment. When nothing happens the contract will transfer after 27 days all those ETH to the attackers account.

This account has around $50 Million worth of ETH.


**What Ethereum be hacked ?**

No The DAO was build on top of Ethereum. Ethereum Just provide the platform in which those contracts are developed and executed. 
Ethereum is like the internet and the DAO like Google or Amazon. 
Blaming ethereum is like blaming the Internet when amazon didn't deliver your package.

**What can we do?**

The community has several solutions all have pro's and con's and all will bring Risks.

***Do nothing***

When we do nothing the ETH will be transferred to the Attacker after 27 days. Some people argued this was the risk of the DAO and its investors and doing nothings is the best way to guarantee neutrality en the immutability of the blockchain.

*Pro's:* 
Ethereum ensured that the blockchain is immutable and neutral, also when the event is a bad one.

*Con's:* 
Doing nothing could look like Ethereum is not a safe place for money because money has been stolen and people can get away with it.


***Soft fork***

The Ethereum Developers suggested a soft fork. With a soft fork you create new rules WITHIN the existing rules of the blockchain.

With this Soft Fork the developers will create a rule that will prevent  the Attacker form accessing his account and their Coins.

*Pro's:* 

The attacker will not get the money.

Will send a huge message that attacks like these are senseless.

*Cons:* 

The blockchain can violated its immutability 

Investors also can't acces the found so the money will be virtually destroyed.

***Hard Fork***

A Hard Fork will create a new set of rules. Because of this a Hard fork is not backwards compatible.

 
*Pro's:* 

Investors get their money back

*Cons:*

The blockchain can violated its immutability 

Requires all the miners to agree. Could divide the community 

 ***Issue a Reward***

The attacker may get a lot of money it will be difficult to move it since the whole community is watching. By providing a bounty for the returned Coins. The attacker will have a nice amount freely spendable and the DAO its money back without messing with the block chain.

*Pro's*:

The blockchain is still immutable

The money is returned

*Con's:*

We would reward criminal behavior which could attract New attackers 

***Why is The Ethereum Foundation so involved with this ?***

First of all this event creates huge negative publicity the ethereum ecosystem. The reaction on this event will be one of the defining moments of Ethereum and Crypto currency so it is important to make a decision to react or not based on rational arguments which is difficult in a world with so many stakeholders and different priorities. 


Secondly Ethereum will switch within a few months from Proof of Work,  a system that validates its transactions by miners,  To Proof of stake, a system that validates its transaction by Coin holders. This system is based on the community of Eth holders. The attackers will get $50MM of ether or roughly 5% of all the ETH. In a POS system he will have significant power, which people don't like to give to someone that got it by stealing money.


**Any other questions we should add?**",1466415549
2278,ethereum,"Sensitive contracts should have functions to freeze themselves and migrate to new contracts, subject to the approval from a majority of ETH holders","This way, no need to fork the blockchain. You can do just the same at the contract level. It's more modular.

What the DAO did right is the delay required to take ether out of the contract. This leaves time to call for a vote to freeze, program a new contract and call for a vote to migrate. However, the DAO left the possibility for users to be locked out of the contract that holds their ether (the Dark DAO). Enabling all ETH holders to vote guarantees that not everybody will be locked out.

You could argue that it makes the contract risky, but no more than the threat of blockchain forks. It's a compromise to have a safety net. If you don't want the Ethereum community to be able to override the code, just don't include the functions, but then don't come asking for blockchain forks.

And if a simple majority (50+%) is not enough, you could require a higher percentage of approval (66? 75%? 95%?).

Like Stephan Tual quite rightly says:  ""the attackers hail from a small group that follows security advisories very closely, of which the vast majority are our trusted friends, work colleagues and advisors are part of. I’m personally convinced at least one of us must have bumped into the attacker at a conference or meetup in the past.""

The way I see it, we have 27 days and counting since the heist to Identify him/her/them, and I figure thats more than enough time. What is being done to find the attacker(s)? Is there a list of suspects? Are rewards being offered for information? Are people being questioned? Are any government authorities involved in the investigation?

Do we really want to go forward with a person that arguably does **not** act in the best interest of the community, now having **a substantial role** in the network?

If these transactions are not getting reversed, we will be moving to PoS with the single biggest ETH holder being someone who has been hostile against Ethereum and who wants to see it burn. 

This will build a constant concern for months, maybe years to come.

This should be the main focus of the debate, but still too many are believing this is about saving DAO investors.

People are only thinking about the money, not about the integrity of the network.

I hope the Ethereum community will see this in time and make the correct decision: fix the eco system to its initial state by hardforking.

It will keep the Ethereum network safe, meaning the network can continue to provide value, and providing value is eventually what will drive development (and also the ETHER price for those who are in this for the money). ",1466419685

2287,ethereum,DAO advertised as zero risk,"The DAO was advertised as zero risk. 
In investing, risk = reward.

Anyone who invested in a zero-risk investment should have known that either their return would be zero, or that their premises were wrong and needed checking.

Foolish money poured into the DAO because people kept repeating it's 0 risk, you can get your ether out 1:1 at any time. Not a single investor in the DAO really knew what it was, or how it would behave, act and invest. Despite a complete lack of knowing anything about what the DAO was or would become, this platitude was repeated incessantly, causing more money to flow in, more publicity to come and resulted in a spiral upwards. 

Currently the community is talking about compromising the integrity of Ethereum in order to return the stolen funds. I think that is a huge mistake. We are talking about compromising the integrity of the platform in order to return funds to investors, who did not do their research, ignored the simplest rules of investment, and who believed they would get rich on zero risk. 

On what other platform would such ludicrous ideas be entertained? No matter what you choose to invest in, equities, real estate, currencies, commodities, IP, crypto, whatever, it's your choice, your risk AND your reward. 

For me the equivalent situation is this; you are walking down the street and you see a bunch of people gathered around and cheering. When you approach you see a bunch of people cheering, hollering and winning money. You ask what they are doing and they reply, ""It's so easy, you just have to guess which cup has the ball under it. Don't worry you just watch the ball with the cup under it, you CAN'T lose!"". After you get conned you then demand that it was unfair, it was advertised as no risk, and that everyone around you should change the rules so that you can get your money back.

I know it's hard to accept but the best way forward is for investors to accept they got conned, and for the DAO to return the remaining funds back to investors.

Why would any community reward an investor for being foolish?
And how long can that community survive?

2288,ethereum,The biggest issue Ethereum is trying to solve,"With all the articles coming out analysing the failure of the DAO, the inadequacy of the Solidity, cunnings of the hacker, stumbles of the Ethereum leaders I wonder how many of us and especially those thinkers at the top of this movement realise this one thing: The biggest problem Ethereum is trying to solve is inability of the human race to agree on common objectives.


We just cannot say hey, this is a great idea to try, let’s give it a chance and build it. Yeah, it is a sand castle and will break apart with time, but we can learn from it and build a better one. Just let us build it. But no, there always seems to be a fucker that comes around, stomps through it for little fun, so you have to waste precious time building barriers for such kind.


Ethereum idea is very simple. You have this decentralised internet money Bitcoin flowing all directions, by adding the next level of complexity on that we can create decentralised transparent applications that can do wonderful internet-of-things. Now, all sorts of antiquated corporations run by humans with corrupt practices could be replaced with a program. Open source, open book company structure where people can set the objectives themselves, make decisions and see what’s going on becomes real. The future, bright, amazing, fair and clean is within our reach. The only thing stopping us is ourselves. 

Imperfect code can work, proof-of-stake and proof-of-work is only a patchwork to fix human bugs. Let’s work on our future together and restrain the angry monkey within. Humans, be kind, talk to each other, supress ego, collaborate, now is the time to evolve.

I didn't invest any of my eth in thedao because it sounded like a stupid lumping of money in one risky secondary offshoot that took focus away from  main eth arena.  I was right . The investors were wrong.

If they hardfork I will seriously reconsider what the hell eth is even about.

Maybe eth needs some hardcoding to prevent too big to fail accumulations and prevent hardforking to rescue insiders.

Do not follow the hardfork!

Such hardforking should not even be possible to exclude funds!  As long as it is possible any country anywhere could simply force developers through threat of prison to reverse transactions which takes eth out of independence and into global jurisdictional quagmire.

2298,ethereum,"Fork debate : We are not giving up on immutability, because we never had it to begin with","I wanted to make this post to address the current situation and debunk the most fundamental opposition to the fork. 

There are many benefits of a SF + HF combination, and I won't go over them. I think they have been clearly stated in many other posts. The critics however are mainly focused on a single point : Immutability. ""Hard forking to save ether that was lost because of a badly written smart contract goes against the fundamental principle that smart contracts are immutable and that transactions on the network should be permanent and unchangeable.""

At first sight, this statement may seem reasonable. Isn't it the promise of Ethereum, and more generally blockchain technology ? Isn't it its main selling point ?
Well, not quite. Let me explain why.

Every blockchain works on social consensus. There is a big gap between what we wish the blockchain was, and what it really is. There are lots of misconceptions and false advertising on the properties of smart-contracts. In fact, smart-contracts never were immutable to begin with, nor was any blockchain.

Lots of people seem shocked that a fork has been proposed, but the reality is that anybody can propose a fork at any given time. This is true for Ethereum, but also for Bitcoin, or any other blockchain platform. It means that the community can, at any given time, choose to go back, revert, go against the paradigm of immutability. Here is what you have to understand : Bitcoin and Ethereum are immutable because the community agrees on it. This immutability is implicitly approved by social consensus. We take it for granted, but it is not. 

For a platform to be truly immutable and free of human morals, the only way would be that it maintains itself. Practically speaking, humans would have to give up their control on the client in order to achieve true immutability. Whether this is desirable or not is another debate. 

The fact is that blockchain is - and always has been - backed by social consensus. Given this fact, we should not argue on whether to give up on immutability or not, because there is nothing to give up on. As I said, immutability is granted by social consensus, by the community, that values this principle over morals or human judgement. With the DAO situation, we are contemplating the end of this mighty paradigm. Indeed, we can say whatever we want about principles and ideals, there will come a time where morality takes over. 
Voting no to the fork is just giving immutability some borrowed time.

But if that's the case, does blockchain technology have any use ? Of course it does. It is immutable in some sense. ""The fact that in order to change the blockchain you need a worldwide consensus of over 51% makes it pretty much immutable, more than any other technology we ever had"" (u/yopdog). 
This is what blockchain is really about, connecting people and allowing them to reach social consensus. The theory is not new, it relies on the so-called 'wisdom of the crowd'. The fact that every blockchain community cannot be compelled by a specific government or entity IS its main asset. 

I say 'community' and not miners. Indeed, if a hard fork is proposed, then you will effectively have two version of the ethereum currency. The one that people choose to use, exchanges choose to trade and developper choose to further develop will be the one that holds value. The miners are the primary deciders, but in the end they will mine what the community as a whole wants to use.

An other important point is that people say we shouldn't fork because it was a smart contract that failed, and not Ethereum itself. This argument makes little sense to me. Ethereum is a platform FOR smart contracts, it would be absurd to separate one from the other. The failure of a specific smart contract can affect negatively Ethereum as a whole, and that is the case here. There have been lots of concern regarding the fallout of this exploit. The main one is that someone could possess more than 4% of the total ether supply, and potentially up to 13%. Either way, it is a big threat for the future of the ecosystem, especially because he got this amount for free (the economic profitability doesn't apply here, someone who had to pay for this amount of eth would be a lot less incentivized - economically speaking - to threaten the network in the upcoming months). Thus, we can't blindly let the attacker run away and disregard the consequences, in defense of some paradigm we never actually had.

In conclusion, we should go with what the community wants. Forking does not mean giving up on immutability, because we never had it to begin with. What we had was some artificial immutability implicitly approved by the majority of the community. You can't expect the community to maintain immutability despite everything, because it won't happen. It is time we realized that the blockchain is not free of morals, because we are not, and we control the network. Still, blockchain is very resistant to moral or political bias, because it relies on a worldwide and diversified community. Forking now does not mean forking in every future situation. We remain rational individuals capable of discerning one situation from another.

The debate should not be on immutability per se, but on the relative benefits that a fork gives to the ecosystem. To be specific, does this fork have enough benefits to give up - this time - on the immutability we had implicitly agreed upon ? On balance, I think it is the case but, once again, it is debatable.

2302,ethereum,Saving DAO funds via hardfork is not the same as bailing out a big Bank,"
I hold Ether but did not invest in the DAO so I might be biased. I think this whole analogy with bailing out big banks and too big to fail is flawed. We cannot really compare cryptocurrency with fiat.  We can’t even compare Ethereum with  Bitcoin without making bad generalizations because the whole matter is way too complex.

When big banks were rescued tax money was taken, without consent of tax payers and there is no motivation for banks to not do the same in the future which is outrageous. For saving DAO funds via hard fork nobody’s ether would be taken while still getting the consent from miners is necessary. Since everyone can become a miner if he wants to participate in this kind of decision making this is a pretty decentralized democratic decision. For me this is much better.

I think the whole thing comes down to that now we start to see limitations and flaws of DAPPs in general. The disadvantage of a decentralized system that makes decisions completely without human intervention is that code does not leave room for interpretation. It just does what it is told to do. This is a huge advantage but also has disadvantages as we now see with the DAO. To intervene with a hard fork is a compromise that acknowledges that Ethereum is by no means perfect yet. I can live with that as long as Ethererum still serves an extremely big unaddressed need and has tremendous growth potential.

I can understand the ""code is law"" point of some people and that Ethereum should keep its promise. For me it is totally valid but also feels very fundamentalistic. I think that it derives from a big chunk of crypto-people beeing engineers (like me).
As as I understood it Bitcoin just did not have the same capabilities at reversing Mt.Gox as Ethereum does now with the DAO and if it had would probably have done it. This is a very complex matter.

The point that saving DAO funds now via hard fork will lead to people writing bad code in the future because they know they will get bailed out is also not valid for me. The DAO is done. Slock.it is done. Nobody was bailed out and no company wants to face this destiny. Big banks keep speculating because they know there is a safety net. There isn't one in Ethereum. This is completely different.

I don't worry at all that a hard fork in the end would kill the Ethereum ecosystem because it sets a precedence. This is just like all the cries for ""Bitcoin is DEAD"" that happened in the past. 
This always happens when people get disillusioned and disappointed because they find out that their revolutionary cryptocurrencies have flaws too. There will be DAPPs in the future that will get hacked because it is just fucking hard to write code without bugs. It will take experience and standards to make DAPPs safe but eventually it will happen. In the end it just comes down to: Is there still any value in the whole thing even after we found out there are flaws? I think the value did not decrease at all. Nothing happened that was completely unforeseeable. This is why I will keep investing in Ethereum but you have to decide for yourself.

2303,ethereum,"I hear this alot these days, but it is a fundamentally flawed argument.","&gt; If over 51% the network agree on it, ANY, I repeat, ANY code can be changed. This has been and will always be true. This is simply how blockchains work. There is no such thing as ""precedent"" in blockchains because the situation can always change and they are not run under the law of governments, therefore the slippery slope is a fallacy. 

But heres the thing, can miners in bitcoin vote on a patch that changes the code of an app built on bitcoin? Say open bazar? Or shapeshift? NO miners in bitcoin cannot do that because apps are COMPLETELY SEPARATE from network consensus. 

Network consensus is for the network, and only the network. Thats how blockchains work.

In ethereum, it turns out that network consensus is also for the apps that are built on ethereum. This is a huge difference from peoples idea of how blockchains work, and a very real vulnerability in the long term.

It is my belief that if ethereum is going to gain mainstream trust, developers have to be certain that the businesses they build are not going to be subject to change or censorship based on network consensus.

This is not possible in bitcoin, but it is possible in ethereum.

So no, this is not how blockchains work, and ethereum has a big decision ahead of it. I think once this fork brings awareness to the fact that apps built on ethereum are subject to change and censorship by network consensus ethereum will have lost its promise of decentralisation, because 51% of miners voting to change an app is a central point of failure. Alot more trust has to be placed in the ethereum miners than in bitcoin miners.

We talk about ethereum being immune to censorship by trusted third parties. But in ethereum miners (3rd parties) have the ability to, if they reach consensus, censor applications.

Bitcoin does not work like this on the application level. Only ethereum puts apps or businesses in this position. And this fork is only proving how possible that reality is.

When I heard about ethereum it was my assumption that if you build an app or a Dapp then it is untouchable by anyone forever. But this drama is proving otherwise and showing that harsh reality to the world. 

Ethereum apps are not immune to censorship by trusted third parties. We just have to TRUST that miners will never reach consensus to change the code of an app.

This debacle has shown the world that ethereum is NOT trustless.

It is mine, and many other peoples opinion, that if ethereum is to last long term and maintain trust long term, then there needs to be hard coded gurantees that application level changes to apps are impossible even by network consensus. The only thing network consensus should be for is to make changes to the core protocol. Businesses and apps should be completely separate from network consensus.

My analogy. Imagine if every user of the internet today (from my grandma to an african teenager in Kenya) had a vote in which applications should run on the internet. 51% of the population would be deciding how the 49% live their lives! How on earth is that a democratic system?

So if this is also true of ethereum how on earth is ethereum a democratic system? 51% deciding what apps the 49% can use. That is the opposite of democracy!",1466423907

In the real world, if a big time thief is caught, and is resourceful enough, the court will force him to pay back more than he stole, to make up for the damage. Shouldn't we do the same?

And what about the *intent*? Even though the DAO smart contract doesn't specify any penalties to bad actors, clearly the intent wasn't that the DAO holders want to be hacked. The DAO developers didn't *mean* to waste their time and resources on fixing this crisis, and neither did the Ethereum Foundation. They deserve a compensation for their time and for their damaged reputation.
The *intent* of the contract was to help fund decentralized projects. So instead of fighting over returning funds to investors, shouldn't the community find that attacker and force him to pay everything he has, via a hard fork, so that these funds can be given to those projects? It's clearly the right thing to do!

I hope everyone considers the slippery slope here before continuing with a hard fork.

The Smart Contract principle was always:

Since nobody solved Bitcoin's 51% attack problem, it was always there and everybody accepted it implicitly.

There is no absolute, there is no SkyNet that operates outside of the human domain. It was always part of our operation, so nothing fundamental is changed here. It always had an ""override"" switch built-in, by design.

The only question is ""what forks are allowed?"" and this question can only be answered by forking and observing which chain wins.

It would be helpful to specify some limits as a social contract explicitly in the Ethereum's manifesto, but ultimately the raw power decides.

2344,ethereum,Devil's Advocate: What incentive is there for Ethereum holders who did not participate in The DAO to allow a hard fork?,"Please don't downvote this as trolling - I'm asking this question as a DAO Token Holder myself  in the spirit of fairness and for a better understanding of both sides of the argument.

What incentive does someone who just holds Ethereum have to allow a hardfork to go through? If anything, the permanent locking up of DAO Ether would be a perfect outcome for such a person, their own Ether will have become just that bit more rarer and more valuable in the long run. From this standpoint burning the DAO Ether is preferred.

Add to this some underlying resentment towards an independent project that they had no interest in causing their personal Ether to crash in price you can understand the desire to recoup some of that value any way possible, even at the expense of DAO Ether being lost.

I've seen people citing the early Bitcoin blockchain hard forks as a precedent for executing a hard fork to save The DAO Ether. I'm not sure that is a fair comparison as the issue being fixed at the time was a problem resulting from an issue with the Bitcoin core code. In the case of The DAO nothing went wrong with Ethereum itself, it was entirely down to The DAO code and how it was written and how it was executed.

The letter ""O"" in DAO stands for ""Organisation"". There was another organisation not long ago that lost a significant amount of cryptocurrency due to theft. It's name was Mt Gox.

This is Ethereum's Mt Gox moment and the question needs to be asked: Isn't Ethereum performing a hard fork to recover funds from an ""Organisation"" gone bad no different to the idea of Bitcoin doing a hard fork to recover Mt Gox funds?",1466433976

I'm sorry you lost money, but the reality of it is that that Ethereum *worked as intended*, the problem was there was a vulnerability in the DAO's contract, and people just shrugged it off.

2351,ethereum,"On 51%, soft forks and hard forks.","There seems to be a lot of misconception about how blockchains work and what can be done with 51% of the mining power, with soft forks and with hard forks.  Reading this ultra-brief condensation of what can be done in the scenarios listed will not actually teach you how they work, but it will summarize what can be done in each case.

I hope this beginners' guide will assist in keeping the conversation here informed about facts.  

WHAT CAN AND CAN'T BE DONE WITH 51% OF THE HASHING POWER OF MINERS:

YOU CAN:
If a group ""controls more than 50% of the network's computing power can, for the time that (they are) in control, exclude and modify the ordering of transactions. This allows (them) to:

- Reverse transactions that (they) send while (they are)  in control. This has the potential to double-spend transactions that previously had already been seen in the block chain.
- Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations
- Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks

YOU CAN'T
The (group) can't:

- Reverse other people's transactions
- Prevent transactions from being sent at all (they'll show as 0/unconfirmed)
- Change the number of coins generated per block
- Create coins out of thin air
- Send coins that never belonged to (them)

Source: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weaknesses#Attacker_has_a_lot_of_computing_power
Note: This is no different on the Ethereum blockchain.  Also note, I've changed the word ""attacker"", ""he"", ""him"", etc... to ""They"" and ""their"" and corrected the conjugation of the associated verbs.


WHAT CAN AND CAN'T BE DONE WITH SOFT FORKS

This is a little bit more technically complicated to explain. A soft fork is a change to only the code that miners run, which restricts some functionality in the broader specification of the software that runs on all nodes.  While no additional functionality is offered, the restriction of some aspect of old functionality can actually cause something new to arise.  For example, by not mining the transactions of a particular address, the feature of address freezing is created.  Soft forks do not have to be run by the entire group of miners, but as soon as the fork takes place and a miner who hasn't adopted the fork mines a transaction that would now be invalid, he will be working on a different chain and any block he mines with a now invalid transaction will become orphaned and excluded from the chain if a majority of miners are running the soft fork.

A soft fork cannot:
- reverse transactions that have been confirmed without re-mining the other transactions in those blocks
- change the number of coins generated per block
- create coins out of thin air
-Send coins from an address without the private keys to the address

WHAT CAN AND CAN'T BE DONE WITH HARD FORKS

A hard fork is change to the specification which must be adopted by both the miners and the client nodes (i.e. wallets) running the protocol.  Any wallets or miners that do not install the new software will end up on a DIFFERENT FORK OF THE CHAIN, effectively making one of the chains an alt-coin to the original.  

While a lot can be done with a hard fork, including creating coins out of thin air, sending coins from an address without the private keys to the address CANNOT be done.  An similar, but not equivalent thing that CAN be done is to make it impossible to spend from a particular address and create new coins at a new address to which someone else holds the private keys.  Although no details have been shared with the public about how a hard fork will return attacker Ether to the DAO, I expect it will have to be some variant of this.

The Ethereum ecosystem will be under much more development than for example bitcoin which will necessarily bring along more problems. Therefore I believe it to be good idea to start brainstorming about cases that can go wrong in the future where forking may be appropriate to rectify the mistake (or not). Maybe over time we can develop guidelines for which cases justify a fork and which don't. I will make a start by giving some examples (I try to order them with those at the top for which most people will likely advocate a fork). Please add more in the comments. In the end many real cases will likely be gray areas and a consensus decision will be required (also see [this awesome post](https://redd.it/4on8ot) ).

** 1. Bugs in the core protocols **

For example it may turn out that Casper has a serious flaw and we need to get back to PoW. Or the EVM might turn out buggy at some point.

** 2. Bugs in sub protocols **

Ethereum is designed to be more modular than other crypto currencies. This brings more stability overall but also more attack vectors on parts of the system. For example when it is possible to choose different algorithms for signing transactions it might turn out that one of them has a flaw. Will we fork for a signing algorithm used by 50% of the users? For a highly experimental one used by 0.1%?

** 3. Bugs in high level contract languages **

There can be a bug in Solidity such that the EVM is still working as specified but the Solidity code is not compiled into safe byte code. Other higher level languages might have such flaws. Is it okay to fork for a Solidity bug? For a less used language?

** 4. Bugs in clients **

Even with the protocol working perfectly, the clients may be open to attacks (eg. making wrong transactions in certain circumstances). Is it okay to fork for bugs in the go or cpp client? For some side project client written in Clojure?

** 5. Bugs in Contracts **

Smart contracts may not behave as intended (as we should all know by now). As it is not efficient to always write a new contract from scratch we will develop repositories of contracts (maybe some denoted as secure by the Ethereum Foundation). Is it okay to fork for flaws in contracts? For thoses denoted as secure by certain parties? For those holding n% of the Ether? For those trying out new features?

** 6. Bugs in IDEs **

Hopefully IDEs will someday be of great help in writing safer smart contracts. Now if an IDE is build to detect a certain category of bugs (eg. certain recursive call flaws) but misses them in certain instances, will this be justification for a fork? Will it be for Foundation supported IDEs or for smaller 3rd party ones?

This comes mainly from bitcoiners; a beaten and abused people. The reason for their instinctive protests is that bitcoiners are not used to having an actual community. Because of this, they're used to loosing everything when things go wrong, or having to resort to government interventions and other such things. Everyone's on their own. Also, they are heavily censored in their own communication channels. This is why they are so twitchy and aggressive. Fear is all they know.


Fortunately, we have an actual community so we don't have to do this; we can work it out amongst ourselves. I think we should all try and look beyond bitcoin and go at this with an open mind.  Yes, Ethereum tech is solid, so you can make a proper argument that the foundation should not intervene, because it sets a bad precedent. The truth of the matter, though, is that this is early stages and the DAO made everyone over-excited. It was even labeled a ""big DAO experiment"". It's easy to pin all this on Slock.it and vote to burn things to the ground, but that's not what a community of responsible people should do imo. Nobody is arguing that there wasn't any unsubstantiated hype, or that investors should be bailed out (i.e. being handed Ether from other people to compensate for their losses), it's about setting a precedent of how to act when the physical network can't resolve an issue and the community must briefly take over.


Also, for the people that's come to accept that community and network is completely detached, and that thieving sociopaths by default are entitled to their loot: this is not blockchain law. Nowhere does it say that a consensus-based soft- or hard-fork solution is going to kill (or even hurt) a blockchain based network the size of Ethereum. Bitcoin's is essentially a bank (it's even centralized at this point), so the fact that they behave like they do, and that their users are conditioned to accept it, is expected.

2366,ethereum,Arguing Over A Fork Is a Moot Point,"This hack is one of the best things to happen to Ethereum, and blockchains in general, because it is forcing people to become educated about how blockchains actually work. It is beautiful.

Here's how it works:

If a fork is proposed, and adopted by any % of miners, there will be two chains, from which you will be able to pick which one (or even both!) you'd like to participate in. If you want to exist in a world where the DAO hacker has 3M eth, and the chain was never forked, sure! Go ahead! Do it! You can! That's the beauty of the blockchain! If you want to exist in a world where the funds were returned to their rightful owners, sure! Go ahead! Do it! You can!

Blockchains, in their current state, are based on consensus, whether you like it or not.

A hard fork will be proposed. Some will choose to accept it. If you agree, join the hard-forked chain. If you disagree, don't. No need to argue over it here. This is a democracy. If a large enough people do not view your chain as valid, and no funds are backing it, it becomes worthless. That is a fundamental and necessary aspect of the blockchain. Maybe even THE fundamental aspect of the blockchain.

For example: I, for one, will only be viewing the hard-forked chain as the valid chain. Therefore, my funds will only be going towards the hard-forked chain. You are free to vote with your funds however you'd like. Feel free to pour your money into the non-hard-forked chain if you believe that will be the successful one. You are more than welcome to! We can vote however we want with our money! Just know that if not enough people accept a certain chain, the value of that chain will approach 0.

2379,ethereum,Another small-scale attack has been draining The DAO over the last 24h (so far 250 ETH). Attacker uses an address linked to his Poloniex account.,"Since the ""genesis attack"" 3 days ago there have been 3 small-scale copycat attacks ([I reported the first of these yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4ot3z8/dao_is_under_attack_again/)). I don't intend to spam this subreddit each time someone has the brilliant idea of joining the ""Hack The DAO"" game. However, I happened to notice that the second copycat attacker uses an address directly linked to Poloniex.

**Details of the attack**  
I have created a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1veqRFIuvLPigbYO7yJxQ4HXkvKKPUtq0KoFcnBJ9TSM/pubhtml) with some information on all of the attacks. I will keep the spreadsheet updated as further attacks occur. Unlike the other two copycat attacks, the second copycat attacker (attack 3 in the spreadsheet) does not actually call the splitDAO function recursively. Instead he only calls the transfer function during the split, thereby splitting without losing (=paying) any DAO tokens.

**Link to Poloniex**  
The address used by the attacker for this attack is  
    [0xfc4746b3f38f029737608315d63d17f7e867ed35](http://etherscan.io/address/0xfc4746b3f38f029737608315d63d17f7e867ed35)  
This address received ETH in [this transaction](http://etherscan.io/tx/0x0dc9e1107b8dd3c07cacd09e15a7d2d38270a01610433770f30d489256d9e485) from the address  
    [0x32be343b94f860124dc4fee278fdcbd38c102d88](http://etherscan.io/address/0x32be343b94f860124dc4fee278fdcbd38c102d88),  
which is the Poloniex wallet. So Poloniex should be able to identify this particular attacker.

**What do these copycat attacks mean for The DAO?**  
As the exploit used by the original attacker is fairly easy reproducible, further attacks were to be expected. Keep in mind that all funds stolen are locked in child DAOs for at least 27 days. Whether these funds can be recovered depends mainly on whether or not there will be a soft fork. For details see [koeppelmann's heist FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4os7l5/the_big_thedao_heist_faq/). However if the amount of attacks increases and a significant portion of The DAO's remaining ETH is stolen, it might be a good idea to think about a white hat attack on The DAO to freeze the funds until a soft fork is in place.

**My opinion on the fork issue**  
One important aspect that I think should not be forgotten in the debate is that Ethereum is currently in Homestead and therefore still in beta. For this reason, the barrier for intervention should be lower than e.g. in Metropolis. However I think the arguments against a hard fork are very compelling. I would therefore advocate for the use of a soft fork only. In addition it would be very important to have a fundamental discussion about the role of censorship in Ethereum going forward. I think a ""no censorship whatsoever starting with Metropolis"" rule would be the best way to go.",1466440906

2384,ethereum,Arguing that Ethereum is immutable until a fork happens is a logical fallacy,"Ethereum is no more or less immutable because of a fork.  The potential for a fork is there in the code and a fork doesn't change this.  If you do no want a blockchain where the future direction is decided by consensus, then Ethereum is not for you and neither is any other blockchain in existence.  You are simply applying your own values to it and demanding that everyone else agree with you and this is illogical and some would label it *crazy*.  Don't be crazy.",1466442176
2385,ethereum,Proposed new feature could solve The DAO's hack cleanly without any fork.,"The hard fork many are asking for is nothing but a democratic intervention over the immutability of a contract. I propose this post-act mechanism to formalize that:

**Contract swapping by consensus:** *new contracts can now have a `swap_address : target_contract` field. This puts the contract in a pre-creation phase on which the network decides, by Ether-weighted voting, if it will or will not be created. If so, the contract swaps its address (and balance) with `target_contract`. Else, it self-destructs.*

It could be used to revert The DAO hack without a ""special case"" fork. For that, we'd just swap the child contract with one that refunds the token holders. It works in both big and medium scales. For example, a local government could request the network's consensus to swap a buggy code. Moreover, it can only be used for benevolent causes as it only works with democratic consensus, which is already assumed to be benevolent by the principle of blockchain design itself. The scenario of changing a contract to, for example, hijack your competition company's code is impossible by design. 

We gain a lot: DAO token holders are refunded (but only if the majority decides to), no fork is necessary, history remains clean, no transaction is rolled back, outstanding media PR (""Ethereum community reverses massive hack by vote""), and we gain a simple mechanism for benevolent interventions that don't depend on the devs. Under that view, signing for Ethereum wouldn't be signing for *""build unstoppable programs"" anymore, but, instead, signing for ""programs only stoppable by democratic consensus""*.

2390,ethereum,Soft fork without hard fork is a violation of DTH rights,"There have been a vocal minority here expressing the opinion that we should have a soft fork without a hard fork. I would like to take a little time to outline just why this is the very worst of options available to us.

If the community goes through with the soft fork it takes away the right of investors to use the DAO contract as it was intended. They no longer have the opportunity to split, recursively or otherwise. A soft fork in itself is a violation of blockchain, and as such it is a violation of the rights of the investors and the attacker.

The argument that some appear to be making is that investors were stupid to trust the code in the first place and so any losses are deserved. This is a fair opinion, however you cannot then take away their right to use that code with a soft fork. This amounts to stealing from both the investors and the attacker and redistributing the wealth to ether holders (by reducing the number of ether in circulation). 

If the community decides on a soft fork it has already made a moral judgement call. It has decided that this incident is significant enough to allow for a violation of the rights of investors for the benefit of the greater Ethereum community. It would therefore be immoral to not back this up with a hard fork to make them whole again. If you forget about the words 'soft' and 'hard' the hard fork is no more a violation than the soft fork.

Of course the real reason most argue for a soft and not a hard fork is because a soft fork will increase the value of ether, whereas the results of a hard fork are more debateable. Let's please try not to be so greedy.

As a holder of DAO tokens I would like to express my right to use the contract with which I entrusted my Ether in the way that it was intended or to have my Ether returned to me. No forks or both forks.

Would it make sense to have the following system?

* You upload a contract to the blockchain.
* Along with it are rules for valid and invalid states.
* Anyone can pay Golem to check every possible usage of the contract, to check for invalid states.

With this system, the longer the contract is on the blockchain, the more possibilities are checked. In blockchain explorers you could see ""This contract is 58% checked, pay for checking some more"".

2395,ethereum,Objective Opionion of a Capital Markets Investment Analyst,"A fork of the Ethereum blockchain, either soft, hard, or both, is inappropriate action to take.

Allow me to take a brief step back. My life in the world outside of digital tokens is to analyze various investment opportunities for institutions and private wealth clients. It is time-consuming laborious work, and requires a highly developed skillset, such as that provided by the CFA Charter (look this up if you’ve never heard of it). I was attracted to the ‘cryptocurrency’ space in 2013 following the massive rally in the price of Bitcoin. I’ve followed it extensively as a miner, investor, and promoter since getting involved.

Disclosure alert, I’ve also been a long-time supporter of Ethereum, purchasing and holding since the ICO, and participating in trading over the past several months of volatility to increase my ETH holdings. I believe it has genuine prospect to significantly benefit humanity through the technological advancement being developed by the Foundation. I was not, however, a supporter of TheDAO.

The method with which TheDAO creators launched and promoted the token was both nefarious and manipulative, in my opinion. They created an environment in which quick and early investment was the only way to prevent a negative economic impact from higher artificial inflation through later investing. It was an arbitrary mechanism designed to force people into quick decision making. They eliminated the ability to conduct proper due diligence on both the token and the code. Due diligence is the basis of every investment decision I make, as should it be yours. It was directly due to the method in which TheDAO was launched that I refused to commit my ETH to the project, which as it turns out, was relatively fortuitous. 

However, because of the failure of the masses to properly analyze TheDAO before committing capital, we’re on the brink of a monumentally poor decision to alter the immutability of the Ethereum blockchain to help ‘right the ship’ for those investors. In the real world, capital losses occur to those who improperly evaluate an opportunity. In the digital currency space, a 30-40% loss is relatively small (temporarily ignoring the impact of ETH/USD exchange rate). I’m sure many here have seen tokens gain 1000%, only to subsequently lose 90% of their value within a week. This is not completely uncommon in this frontier we are blazing. But the decision to revert a contract to protect those investors is, I’ll repeat, inappropriate action to take.

I hope Vitalik and team take into account the fact that investment losses can and should occur for poor decisions. It is not Ethereum’s responsibility to right every wrong, simply because a DAPP was built on their blockchain. I implore you to allow these investors to suffer their losses, as unfortunate as the entire situation is. I say this knowing that it will continue to have a short-term negative impact on the value of Ethereum, my holdings included. But the long-term benefits will substantially outweigh any negativity this brings in the short term.

You all have an incredibly difficult decision to make, and a short period of time to make it. Ironically, not too dissimilar from the method in which TheDAO launched. A tremendous amount of information needs to be processed quickly, but the emotions of DAO token-holders should not be the prevailing variable in what you ultimately decide to do. I hope you’ll be able to make the right decision this time around.

Lets say we shouldn't have had a DAO this big for another 2 years.  2 years in the future, we'd have massive mass adoption, we wouldn't be in the ""beta"" phase anymore, and there would be more market awareness of Ethereum. If the DAO hack happened under THOSE circumstances, the fallout for Ethereum would have been catastrophic. As it stands now, it's being contained, and able to be fixed. The sort of recklessness exhibited by Stephan Tual and Slock.it was in a sense a type of antifragility that served to test Ethereum. And lo and behold it created a *massive* bug bounty *very early* in development. Now, we are all doubling down our efforts on security, the Ethereum Foundation is collaborating with more security experts and programmers, and so forth, and as a result we will become stronger. Also, imagine if we DIDN'T have the retarded lockup period. The coins would be moving around to fifty million different addresses, gone for good. We now know to intentionally secure large sums of money for days on end to avoid quick robberies. I mean just the amount of security exploits we've been made aware of, the redoubling down on security, the leadership by Vitalik, all of these things wouldn't exist if it weren't for the reckless nature of TheDAO.

Otherwise, we just want Ether to compete with bitcoin as a currency.","Smart contracts are the real value proposition of Ethereum. Without them, Ethereum is just another altcoin trying to compete with Bitcoin.

Those who are saying that ""why should the rest of the ETH token holders 'bailout' the fuck up of one contract?"", the answer is simple, because at least in this stage of the network, we are in this together. Had DAO succeeded, Ethereum would have gone up in value many many times. 

In fact, DAO's biggest aims were to get more value addition to Ethereum (and make profit in process). 

Lemme use another example:

Level 0 = Ethereum Protocol code

Level 1 = Smart contract code

If there were any bugs in Level 0, I'm sure everybody would universally vote to hard fork to fix the problem. This 'feature' means that Ethereum gets opportunity to recover from it's mishaps and bugs.

But the same privilege is not extended to the Level 1 code. The anti-fork community is screaming and saying ""All Smart Contract code is on its own"".

I would love to have a feature where as a Smart Contract writer, I can deploy a code in a 'mutable' manner, so all investors/users know that the code is still in 'alpha' mode (that their transactions could be rolled back if the losses are HUGE). Once it becomes stable enough, we launch it on an immutable chain. And no, the testchain doesn't really solve this problem (because black hat hackers have no incentive to target smart contracts on it).

Right now, everybody is vilifying the DAO developers. As a programmer it scares the crap out of me and disincentivises me to never take risk of pushing a Smart Contract. That's like vilifying a developer for writing buggy code.

My recommendation is to keep hard/soft forking Smart Contracts (as long as they are not grossly incompetent) until the Smart contracts development becomes secure and relatively bug free. After that, the incubation period ends and blockchain becomes immutable.

Finally, let's not forget, there are numerous features Ethereum has (like the 17 block time) which were paid for by the lessons from the Bitcoin community. We have been working with a relatively bug free protocol, but further development isn't possible if there is no margin [for error](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4oyxy6/ethereum_is_doomed_satoshi_nakamoto_institute/d4grbqh)",1466452075

**Summary:**

**(1) Turing-complete languages are fundamentally inappropriate for writing ""smart contracts""** - because such languages are inherently [*undecidable*](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=turing+g%C3%B6del+undecidability&amp;ia=web), which makes it impossible to know what a ""smart contract"" will do *before* running it.

**(2) We should learn from [Wall Street's existing DSLs (domain-specific languages) for financial products and smart contracts, based on declarative and *functional* languages such as Ocaml and Haskell](http://dslfin.org/resources.html)** - instead of doing what [the Web 2.0 ""brogrammers"" behind Solidity](http://gavwood.com/) did, and [what Peter Todd is also apparently embarking upon](https://petertodd.org/2016/state-machine-consensus-building-blocks): ie, ignoring the lessons that Wall Street has already learned, and ""reinventing the wheel"", using less-suitable languages such as C++ and JavaScript-like languages (Solidity), simply because they seem ""easier"" for the ""masses"" to use.

**(3) We should also consider using *specification* languages (to say *what* a contract does) along with *implementation* languages (saying *how* it should do it)** - because specifications are higher-level and easier for people to read than implementations which are lower-level meant for machines to run - and also because ecosystems of specification/implementation language pairs (such as Coq/Ocaml) support [**formal reasoning and verification** tools](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=specification+implementation+%22formal+verification%22&amp;ia=web) which could be used to mathematically prove that a smart contract's implementation is ""correct"" (ie, it satisfies its specification) *before* even running it.

When I have more time later, I will hopefully be able to write up a more gentle introduction on all this stuff, providing more explanations, motivations, and examples for laypersons who are interested in getting a feel for the deep subtle mathematical implications at play here in these emerging ""language design wars"" around recent proposals to add ""smart contracts"" to cryptocurrencies.

Right now I'm just providing this quick heads-up / reminder / warning, alluded to in the title of the OP, with some more pointers to the literature in the links above.

People who already do have a deep understanding of mathematics and its history will get the message right away - by recalling the crisis in the foundations of mathematics which occurred in the early 1900s, involving concepts like Russell's paradox, Gödel's incompleteness theorem, undecidability, Turing completeness, etc.

**Turing-complete languages lead to ""undecidable"" programs (ie, you cannot figure out what you do until *after* you run them)**

One hint: recall that Gödel's incompleteness theorem *proved* that any mathematical system which is *(Turing)-complete*, must also be *inconsistent* - that is, in any such system, **it must be possible to formulate propositions which are *undecidable within that system*.**

This is related to things like the Halting Problem. 

And by the way, Ethereum's concept of ""gas"" is *not* a real solution to the Halting Problem: Yes, running out of ""gas"" means that the machine *will* ""stop"" eventually, but this naïve approach does *not* overcome the more fundamental problems regarding undecidability of programs written using a Turing-complete language.

The take-away is that: 

**When using any Turing-complete language, it will *always* be possible for someone (eg, the DAO hacker, or some crook like Bernie Madoff, or some well-meaning but clueless dev from slock.it) to formulate a ""smart contract"" whose meaning *cannot* be determined *in advance* by merely inspecting the code: ie, it will *always* be possible to write a smart contract whose meaning can only be determined *after running the code*.**

**Take a moment to contemplate the full, deep (and horrifying) implications of all this.**

Some of the greatest mathematicians and computer scientists of the 20th century already discovered and definitively proved (much to the consternation most of their less-sophisticated (naïve) colleagues - who nevertheless eventually *were* forced to come around and begrudgingly agree with them) that:

- **Given a ""smart contract"" written in a Turing-complete language...**

- **it is impossible to determine the semantics / behavior of that ""smart contract"" *in advance*, by mere inspection - either by a human, or even by a machine such as a theorem prover or formal reasoning tool** (because such tools unfortunately only work on more-restricted languages, not on Turing-complete languages - for info on such more-restricted languages, see further below on ""constructivism"" and [""intuitionistic logic""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_logic)).

The horrifying conclusion is that:

- **the only way to determine the semantics / behavior of a ""smart contract"" is ""after-the-fact"" - ie, by actually running it on some machine (eg, the notorious EVM) - and waiting to see what happens** (eg, waiting for a hacker to ""steal"" tens of millions of dollars - simply because he understood the semantics / behavior of the code better than the developers did.

This all is based on a very, very deep result of mathematics (Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem, as referenced in some of the links above) - which even many mathematicians themselves had a hard time understanding and accepting. 

And it is also very, very common for programmers to not understand or accept this deep mathematical result. 

**Most programmers do *not* understand the implications of Gödel's incompleteness theorem on Turing-complete languages**

*As a mathematician first, and a programmer second*, I can confirm from my own experience that **most programmers do *not* understand this important mathematical history at all, and its implications** - it is simply too subtle or too foreign for them to grasp. 

Their understanding of computing is childish, naïve, and simplistic. 

They simply view a computer as a marvelous machine which can execute a sequence of instructions in some language (and please note that, for them, that language usually happens to simply ""come with"" the machine, so they unquestionably accept whatever language that happens to be - ie, they almost never dive deeper into the subtle concepts of ""language design"" itself - a specialized area of theoretical computer science which few of them ever think about).

**Paradigms lost**

As we've seen, time after time, this failure of most programmers contemplate the deeper implications of ""language design"" has has led to the familiar litany of disasters and ""learning experiences"" where programmers have slowly abandoned one ""programming paradigm"" and moved on to the next, after learning (through bitter experience) certain hard facts and unpleasant, non-intuitive realities which initially escaped their attention when they were simply enjoying the naïve thrill of programming - such as the following:

- [GO TO is considered harmful](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=go+to+considered+harmful&amp;t=disconnect&amp;ia=web);

- TRY / CATCH / THROW constructs are considered harmful (they're not much better than GO TO in terms of program control flow);

- callbacks in languages like node.js are considered harmful (they result in unreadable spaghetti code, which is totally obviated in more advanced functional languages with [monads](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=monad+tutorial&amp;t=disconnect&amp;ia=web));

- destructive update / assignment is considered harmful (when compared with [immutable data structures](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=clojure+immutable&amp;t=disconnect&amp;ia=software) - which are by the way essential for parallelism - and we should remember that any cryptocurrency runtime environment will by definition be parallel);

- [the procedural / imperative paradigm is considered harmful (when compared with the declarative paradigm)](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=imperative+declarative+paradigm&amp;t=disconnect&amp;ia=web);

- even [the object-oriented paradigm is starting to be considered harmful (when compared with the pure functional paradigm)](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22object+oriented%22+functional&amp;t=disconnect&amp;ia=qa): this is where many programmers are today, going through the ""epiphany"" of moving away from object-oriented languages like C++ or Java, to languages incorporating functional aspects like C# or Scala, or languages which are even more functional such as Haskell, ML, or OCaml;

- more advanced programmers are even starting see that it is considered harmful to *not* initially write (or, just as bad, to *never even get around to writing after the fact*) [a *specification* stating ""what"" a program is supposed to do, before proceeding to write (or semi-automatically *derive*) an *implementation* stating ""how"" it should do it](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=specification+implementation+%22formal+verification%22&amp;ia=web) (*cough, cough* - see the ""Bitcoin reference implementation"" in the low-level C++ language, with which all other implementations are expected to be ""100% bug compatible"": this is an utter abomination and disgrace, to expect the ""worldwide ledger"" to run on a system which no carefully designed human-readable *specification* - merely an increasingly spaghetti-code-like *implementation* which can only be parsed by the inner priesthood of pinheads at Core/Blockstream - and trust me, this is one [""worse is better""](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=worse+is+better&amp;t=disconnect&amp;ia=about) situation which they're perfectly comfortable with, because it simply cements their power even further by discouraging the rest of us from examining ""their"" code and contributing to ""their"" project) - and by the way, the [Curry-Howard Isomorphism](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=curry+howard+isomorphism&amp;t=disconnect&amp;ia=about) tells us that *providing an implementation without a specification* would be just as bad / ridiculous / meaningless / pointless as (ie, it is mathematically equivalent / isomorphic to) *stating a proof without stating the theorem that is being proved*.

Today, in cryptocurrencies, we are seeing this sad history repeat itself, with plenty of examples of programmers who don't understand these subtle concepts involving the foundations of mathematics - specifically, the mathematical *fact* ([Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=G%C3%B6del%27s+Incompleteness+Theorem&amp;t=disconnect&amp;ia=about)) that any logical system or language which is ""powerful"" enough to be ""Turing complete"" must also be inconsistent.

The naïve Ethereum people think they've cleverly sidestepped this with the notion of ""gas"" but actually all they're doing is cheating with this messy kludge: because simply saying ""we'll arbitrarily make the program stop running at some point"" does *not* make ""smart contracts"" written in Ethereum ""decidable"" - as we've seen, these contracts can still blow up / go wrong in *other* ways before they run out of gas.

Peter Todd /u/petertodd might also be an example of this confusion (given his history, my hunch is that he probably *is* - but I haven't had time to do a thorough investigation yet) - with [his recent post proposing smart contracts in Bitcoin based on the lambda calculus](https://petertodd.org/2016/state-machine-consensus-building-blocks).
 
Basically, the only way to avoid falling into the [""Turing tar-pit""](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=turing+tar+pit&amp;t=disconnect&amp;ia=about) of confusing and misleading semantics / behavior and undecidability will be to use slightly more restricted languages which are carefully designed / selected to *not* be Turing-complete.

**There are plenty of non-Turing-complete lanaguages available to learn from.**

One possibility would be to consider languages which are based on [intuitionistic logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_logic) / [constructivism](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=constructivism+mathematics&amp;t=disconnect&amp;ia=about) / [Martin-Löf's Type theory](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=martin+lof+type+theory&amp;t=disconnect&amp;ia=about) / [Heyting Logic](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=heyting+logic&amp;t=disconnect&amp;ia=web) - which is similar to classical Boolean logic except that Heyting Logic rejects the [Law of the Excluded Middle](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=heyting+logic&amp;t=disconnect&amp;ia=web).

What all these ""schools of mathematics"" have in common is a more restricted and more concrete notion of ""proof"", supporting a safer mode of computation, where something is considered ""proven"" or ""true"" only if you can provide concrete evidence.

By the way, the word ""witness"" in ""Segregated Witness"" - meaning a proof that has been constructed, to ""witness"" the truth of a proposition, or the validity of a block - comes from the realm of constructivism in mathematics.

These languages are somewhat more restricted than Turing-complete languages, but they are still quite expressive and efficient enough to specify nearly any sort of financial rules or ""smart contracts"" which we might desire.

In fact, the notion ""smart contracts"" is actually not new at all, and a lot of related work has already been done in this area - and, interestingly, it is based mostly on the kinds of ""functional languages"" which most of the developers at Core/Blockstream, and at slock.it, are not familiar with (since they are trapped in the imperative paradigm of less-safe procedural languages such as C++ and JavaScript):

**Wall Street is already writing DSLs for ""smart contracts"" - mostly using functional languages**

Check out the many, many languages for smart contracts already being used major financial firms, and notice how most of them are functional (based on Ocaml and Haskell), and not procedural (like C++ and JavaScript):

http://dslfin.org/resources.html

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23448/dsl-in-finance

The lesson to learn here is simple: Just because we are storing our data on a blockchain and running our code on a permissionless distributed network, does *not* mean that we should ignore the rich, successful history of existing related work on designing financial products and ""smart contracts"" which has already been happening on Wall Street using functional languages.

In fact, if we want to run ""smart contracts"" on a permissionless distributed concurrent parallel network (rather than on a centralized system), then it actually becomes even *more* important to use functional and declarative paradigms and immutable data structures supported by languages like Ocaml and Haskell, and avoid the imperative and procedural paradigms involving mutable data structures, which are almost impossible to get right in a distributed concurrent parallel architecture. (See the video [""The Future is Parallel, and the Future of Parallel is Declarative""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlyQjK1qjw8) for an excellent 1-hour explanation of this).

**Only non-Turing-complete languages support formal reasoning and verification**

Basically, a language which is *not* Turing complete, but is instead based on the slightly more restricted [""Intuitionistic Logic""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_logic) or ""Constructivism"", satisfies an important property where it is possible to do ""formal reasoning and verification"" about any program written in that language.

This is what we need when dealing with financial products and smart contracts: we need to be able to *know in advance* ""what"" the program does (ie, *before* running it) - which can be done using tools such as [formal reasoning and verification and ""correctness proofs""](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=formal+reasoning+verification&amp;ia=about) (which are not applicable to Turing-complete languages).

**Turing-complete languages for ""smart contracts"" are needlessly dangerous because you can't figure out in advance what they do**

As the ""language design wars"" around cryptocurrencies and ""smart contracts"" begin to heat up, we must *always* insist on using *only* non-Turing-complete languages which enable us to use the tools of formal reasoning and verification to *mathematically prove in advance* that a ""smart contract"" program actually does ""what"" it is supposed to do.

**Separating *specification* from *implementation* is essential for proving correctness**

A specification stating ""*what* the smart contract does"" should ideally be spelled out *separately* from the implementation stating ""how"" it should do it.

In other words, a high-level, more compact &amp; human-readable *specification* language can be used to mathematically (and in many cases (semi-)automatically) derive (and formally verify - ie, provide a mathematical correctness proof for) the low-level, hard-to-read machine-runnable program in an *implementation* language, which tell them machine ""*how* the smart contract does what it does"".

**A simple list of ""language design"" requirements for smart contracts**

The following considerations are important for ensuring safety of smart contracts:

- At a minimum, we should *only* **non-Turing-complete languages**; and

- Ideally, our toolbox should also allow providing a compact, more human-readable, high-level **specification saying ""what** the smart contract does"", and not just a lengthy, low-level machine-runnable **implementation saying ""how** it should do it"".

- Finally, wherever possible, we should also use tools for **formal reasoning and verification** so that we can *prove in advance* that the ""how"" of any smart contract's machine-runnable *implementation* does indeed satisfy the ""what"" of its human-readable *specification* (However, [several people have already pointed out that this idealistic ""reasoning and verification"" requirement may probably turn out to be a very challenging task for code intended to run on a permissionless, massively parallel, concurrent, distributed, worldwide computing network](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/4ois15/would_the_smart_formal_methods_people_here_mind/) - since this is actually cutting-edge research involving non-determinism, as manifested, for example, in the ""game theory"" scenarios we often hear about).

So, the requirements for languages for smart contracts should include:

(1) Our language should be **non-Turing complete** - ie, it should be based instead on ""Intuititionistic Logic"" / ""Constructivism"";

(2) We should favor declarative languages (and also things like immutable data structures) - because these are the easiest to run on parallel architectures.

(3) Our toolbox should support **formal reasoning and verification**, allowing us to mathematically prove that a low-level machine-runnable **implementation** *satisfies* its high-level, human-readable **specification** *before* we actually run it

**Some YouTube videos for further study**

There's a video discussing how declarative languages with immutable data structures (such as Haskell, which is pure functional) are a nice ""fit"" for parallel programming:

The Future is Parallel, and the Future of Parallel is Declarative

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlyQjK1qjw8

There's also some videos about how Jane Street Capital has been successfully using the language OCaml (which includes functional, object-oriented, and imperative paradigms) to develop financial products:

**Lessons from history**

When I see Peter Todd writing a [blog post](https://petertodd.org/2016/state-machine-consensus-building-blocks) where he embarks on informally specifying a new language for ""smart contracts for Bitcoin"" based on lambda calculus, it makes me shudder and recollect [Greenspun's Tenth Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule), which states:

&gt; Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, **bug-ridden**, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp.

Only now, it looks like Peter Todd is going to try to single-handedly re-implement languages like Ocaml and Haskell, and then try to build the same financial DSLs  (domain-specific languages) which Wall Street already built on them. 

I think a much better approach would be to look show a bit more humility, and a little less of the ""NIH"" (not invented here) syndrome, and see what we can learn from the vast amount of existing work in this area - specifically, the DSLs (domain-specific languages) which *Wall Street is already using with great success* for automating financial products and smart contracts:

http://dslfin.org/resources.html

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23448/dsl-in-finance

And remember, most of that existing work involving DSLs for financial products and smart contracts was done on top of functional languages like Ocaml and Haskell - it was *not* done on top of imperative languages like C++ and JavaScript (and Solidity, which is ""JavaScript-like"" in many ways).

There are *reasons* for this - and any so-called dev who ignores that vast body of existing, related work is simply a victim of too much ego and too little awareness of the fin-tech giants who have gone before him.

I'm sure Peter Todd is having a wonderful time being geek with all this - and the hordes of suck-ups and wanna-be's who slavishly worship the C++ pinheads at Core/Blockstream will be duly impressed by all his pseudo-mathematical mumbo-jumbo - but this is mere mental masturbation, if it ignores the major amount of related work that's already been done in this area.

Smart contracts for cryptocurrencies should use Wall Street's existing DSLs financial contracts written in Ocaml and Haskell as a starting point. Eventually maybe we could also even use a language like Coq for writing specifications, and proving that the implementations satisfy the specifications. Any so-called ""dev"" who fails to acknowledge this previous work is simply not serious.

Ignorance is bliss, and cock-sure Peter Todd is probably merely embarking on a futile mission of hubris by trying to create all this stuff from scratch based on his limited experience as a ~~hacker~~ ~~gamer~~ coder coming from the procedural / imperative paradigm, apparently unaware of the decades of related work which have shown that **doing provably correct parallel programming** is a gargantuan arduous challenge which may very well turn out to be insurmountable at this time.**

Lord help us if this immature, ignorant vandal who [wants Bitcoin to fail](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4ols8x/bitcoin_failing_cleanly_is_probably_good_for_my/) takes the ignorant followers of r\bitcoin and Core down the path of these so-called ""smart contracts"" - reinventing decades of work already done on Wall Street and academia using Haskell and Ocaml, as they screw around with ""easier"" languages based on C++ and JavaScript.

2452,ethereum,This DAO stuff is a mess. What if we just... burned it all?,"What if we hard forked to burn all of the ether represented by DAO tokens?

That's crazy! But hear me out. Burning ether guarantees there are no crooked incentives, and that no one profits from this mistake. It meets some demands from both different sides of this debate.

**The anti-hard-forkers say:**

&gt;Forking to return the stolen ether would set a bad precedent. If we save this ""unwisely invested"" ether, it encourages unwise investment, similar to bank bailouts.

If the ether is burned, it sets a precedent that unwise investments will not be saved by some sort of governing body. At the same time, it sets a precedent that the community won't just let an attacker ""get away with it"", if the amount stolen is suitably large.

&gt; Hard forking to reverse the theft is unfair to ETH holders vs DAO holders. ETH holders wisely did not invest, so to compromise the purity of the blockchain just so DAO holders can recover their unwise investment is not fair to those who held back.

If the ether from the unwise investment is burned, all ETH holders realize the increased value from such a large burn of the supply, and they can still trust that the blockchain won't be trying to ""make whole"" unwise investors.

**The pro-hard-forkers say:**

&gt; Unless we hard fork, the attacker would control 15% of all ether. They could sell and cause a price crash. Perhaps more dangerously, they would have huge control after the system switches to POS.

If the ether is burned, this is not an issue.

&gt; We can't allow such a large investment of ether to be destroyed/stolen. It would severely damage faith in the protocol.

If the ether is burned, the token history still remains. Obviously they will not have nearly the same value. However, if the ether has been *destroyed by community consensus*, rather than *stolen by an attacker*, the value of these tokens would mean something different. It's possible the community can find some creative way of recognizing these tokens for what they represent: a leap of faith on the part of investors on a technology that unfortunately was too untested to survive.

Yes, people will have lost money. But it's money that was thrown into a contract with a bug. People who invested chose to trust whatever they read, and that trust proved to be faulty. The trust in ethereum (so far) has not proven to be a bad choice; only trust in TheDAO and slockit's security audits. Yes, ""the media"" might portray it as a failure of ethereum, but honestly, we should be used to ""the media"" getting the details wrong by now. The strong hands will recognize where the fault truly lies.

I don't really expect this to get a lot of traction. But in my opinion, it's the best way forward to maintain a ""pure"" track record for ethereum as well as stumping the attacker. Obviously DTHs and slockit have reason to be against this proposal. But as far as the long term health of Ethereum, I think this is the way to go.",1466459597

2458,ethereum,"Blockchain Originalists and ""The Code is Law"" utopians, get over yourselves already.","Seriously. Ethereum, like the blockchain space as a whole, is a nascent technology barely *into* its swaddling clothes. It's not the frikkin Constitution. Not yet, anyway. Sorry-but-not-sorry, if I seem to slap some people's sacred cow in the face here, but implementing a soft/hardfork at this juncture is not going to be the death knell for Ethereum; nor will it hinder the progress of decentralization in general, whose path we cannot dictate in advance and which will surely involve many stumbles for years to come. Inconveniently right now, a sense of proportion, not to mention ethics, requires a lot more emotional/intellectual maturity than it takes to get a hard-on about 'code' and a burgeoning market cap. Where that level of maturity is absent, what we see is just the flip-side of the same collective psychology that actually got us into this mess: A mix of naivete and arrogance, grandiosity, hasty assumptions, reactivity.  

But guess what - those have their place too. Without the folly of youth, you don't get the wisdom of age. Over-reaching and hubris, followed by a humbling smackdown - that's human progress in a nutshell. What we are doing now is learning and growing up. Ethereum is the Gifted Children's program of crypto, and that's something to feel good about. 

The proposed fork solution to the DAO hack is a path to at least a partial, and possibly a full, remediation of harm done. It is likely doable. It is not the arbitrary whim of a person or special-interest group, it cannot be done by 'fiat' and I use the term advisedly. For the ecosystem to defend and heal itself in this way would be a *demonstration* of our decentralized agility and adaptive strength, not a reversion to centrality or a caving-in of our larger ideals. 

One clear takeaway from this event is that we need more rigor in our standards of code review. No less important is greater vigilance about our thinking and ourselves.

**Child:** ""Elder, tell me, why are there many Ways and not just one?""

**Elder:** ""Ah, excellent question, Child.  Long ago, the Old Ones desired a fresh communal order, an order that that would stretch out over and above the old canons.  They spoke thusly: 'Our canons grow old and constricting.  Let us write a new Anthem, an Anthem with a chorus that itself would beget new songs for us to sing together.'  So the bards among them quickly set about composing the verses of this Anthem.""

""With the completed Anthem in hand, the Old Ones gathered together and sang out loudly in unison. The melodic notes of the Anthem brought the First Way into being, constituted from the celestial Aether.

""The First Way had the vitality and fullness of new life, and expanded into its place in the Firmament that surrounds us all.  However, many also looked upon the First Way and coveted its strength.""

""Remember Child, at the commencement of that ancient age, Ways could not think or speak for themselves.  In many aspects, they were children, babes really, much younger than yourself.""

**Elder:** ""Now, before the First Way had even been suckled, the trickster with many names surfaced.  He has been called Coyote, Loki.  But we call him-""

**Child:** ""Attacker!""

**Elder:** ""Child, you have studied well! Yes, you are correct: Attacker-of-the-Way.  Attacker sang the Song of Dividing, as it was in the nature of the First Way.

**Elder:** ""the Dark Way.  And the Dark Way expanded itself greedily from the life blood of the First Way.  The Old Ones immediately fell ashen at the rapid draining of the First Way,  and were equally dismayed at the finding of the hidden verse, Dischord.  In their desperation, they themselves sang Dischord to redivide and redeem the stolen life blood contained in the Dark Way.  The Attacker and and Old Ones successively sang Dischord.  And sang.  And sang.  And sang...

My question is can ether have an individual code associated with it, so anybody that buys ether whether it be 1 x ether or a 1000 x ether. Each 1 would have some sort of code or serial number attached to it for some type of identification. For example if a gang robbed a cash in transit van and ran away with a box stuffed with cash. They find a quite location break open the box and instantly red/pink dye showers the money inside rendering said money useless as it can't be washed out and no bank or retail outfit would accept said cash as they are running to the phone to call the police. So could ether have something similar associated with it. With that in mind the guy or girl who obtained those ether tokens whether correctly or incorrectly, would it therefore be plausible if ether tokens were somehow assigned a code or serial number they could be rendered useless as the gang who robbed the cash in transit van found out when red/pink dye sprayed there windfall useless.

I stopped when I realized that all you need is the private key to unlock a wallet without even knowing the public address. The dev of the wallet explained to me that it would take too much computational power to do such thing. Can anyone verify that this is true? And even if it is, why would Ethereum set it up this way? It seems like it would've made more sense to go the traditional route of requiring the owner of account to know the username/password combination instead of requiring just a password to gain access. 

Below is the link and the portion in question.

https://www.myetherwallet.com/#help

18. Couldn't everybody could put in random private keys, look for a balance, and send to their own address?

Short version: yes, but finding an account with a balance would take longer than the universe...so...no.

Long ELI5 Version: So Ethereum is based on Public Key Cryptography, specifically Elliptic curve cryptography which is very widely used, not just in Ethereum. Most servers are protected via ECC. Bitcoin uses the same, as well as SSH and TLS and heaps of other stuff. The Ethereum keys specifically are 256-bit keys, which are stronger than 128-bit and 192-bit, which are also widely used and still considered secure by experts.

In this you have a private key and a public key. The private key can derive the public key, but the public key cannot be turned back into the private key. The fact that the internet and the world’s secrets are using this, or a variation of, this cryptography means that if for some reason there is suddenly a way to go from public key -&gt; private key, your lost ETH is the least of everyone’s problems.

Now, that said, YES if someone else has your private key then they can indeed send ETH from your account. Just like if someone has your password to your email, they can read and send your email, or the password to your bank account, they could make transfers (or maybe pay your bills). For this reason, you could download the Keystore version of your private key which is the private key, encrypted with a password. This is like having a password that is also protected by another password.

And YES, in theory you could just type in a string of 64 hexadecimal characters until you got one that matched. In fact, smart people could write a program to very quickly check random private keys. This is known as ""brute-forcing"" or ""mining"" private keys. People have thought about this long and hard, especially when Bitcoin exploded. With a few very high end servers, they may be able to check 1M+ keys / second. However, even checking that many per second would not yield access to make the cost of running those servers even close to worth while - it is more likely you, and your great-grandchildren, will die before getting a match.

If you know anything about Bitcoin, this will put it in perspective: To illustrate how unlikely this is: suppose every satoshi of every bitcoin ever to be generated was sent to its own unique private keys. The probability that among those keys there could be two that would correspond to the same address is roughly one in 100 quintillion.

If you want something a bit more technical, take a look here: These numbers have nothing to do with the technology of the devices; they are the maximums that thermodynamics will allow. And they strongly imply that brute-force attacks against 256-bit keys will be infeasible until computers are built from something other than matter and occupy something other than space.

Of course, this all assumes that keys are generated in a truly random way &amp; with sufficient entropy. The keys generated here meet that criteria. geth/Mist as well. Jaxx as well. The Ethereum wallets are all pretty good. Keys generated by brainwallets do not, as a person's brain is not capable of creating a truly random seed. There have been a number of other issues regarding lack of entropy or seeds not being generated in a truly random way in Bitcoin-land, but I'll save that for another day.

2509,ethereum,Exploring possible improvements to Ethereum Smart Contract Language (Solidity) to mitigate future hacks.,"So right off the bat, I would like to say, that I am a big supporter of Ethereum and the Ethereum community.  I am by no means an expert in building languages, however I’ve been around the block a few times. I’ve built a couple of toy interpreters for fun. I’ve been a developer for 17+ years, using many high level languages such as C#, Java, Python, etc.. So I really appreciate the enormity of what Ethereum is trying to achieve.

After examining he Dao attack described here http://hackingdistributed.com/2016/06/18/analysis-of-the-dao-exploit/
It becomes increasingly clear that these types of hacks are very difficult to discover even by expert programmers, because there are many subtle hidden bugs that are all related to program state, and recursive execution.

In order to mitigate some of these attacks, I believe the Solidity language needs to provide a number of constructs to help contract writers, write safer code.

At the heart of the problem, I believe is the .call() and .send() functions. In fact from a security perspective, the execution of a contract in my view does nothing until tokens are transferred from one account to another.

So very simplistically I see Solidity code in its most basic way as follows:

* Blah
* Code
* **.call()**
* More
* Code
* **.send()**
* More
* Code




**Security Policies**

I believe that Solidity needs to be improved by keeping close track of .call() and send() functions in a very explicit way. One way of doing this is through a new construct that can be called a Security Policy. Security policies can be thought of as kind of a double check, or an explicit assertion that is always executed prior to calling .call() or .send() functions. Security Policies can be defined at different levels of scope, but by default their scope should be defined at a global level (I leave it up to the experts how to implement this). 

So for instance when The Dao got hacked, a simple security policy might have been to never allow a particular dao account to ask for more money then it is entitled to, and because the Security Policy is triggered every time someone calls .call() or .send() it has full visibility of who is calling these methods and how many times.

The Security Policy should be an explicit feature that is built into Solidity and will act as an explicit fail safe against hacks. 

Another Security Policy might be that a .call() or a .send() can never be called more than X amount of times per 1 minute, and if this is exceeded then a security alert is raised. (This is similar to the password retry found in an Os) This will significantly slow down attacks.


Of course it is still the responsibility of a Contract writer to make use of Security Policies, but by making this an explicit security feature of Solidity it gives a level of assurance that if it all goes to hell at least there are some safety measures in place.

There may be other ways/methods to improve security, but one thing is for sure, Solidity must be improved in order for Contract Writers to have more confidence in the code they write.

2515,ethereum,To The Attacker and the Ethereum community,"===== BEGIN SINGING TELEGRAM =====

To The Attacker and the Ethereum community,

We, the Ethereum community, are facing our first moral and technical crisis after a pseudonymous identity, known as The Attacker, exploited a vulnerability in The DAO to siphon funds away from their intended use for blockchain startups. The scale of this event is as staggering as the level of interest generated by The DAO project itself, the fallout similarly vast in its implications. Many have detailed various aspects of this event but I want to address some concerns.

While the meatspace identity of The Attacker is unknown and alleged communication from them failed verification, I am of the mind that it does not matter who they are because identity is communally formed. If there's anything we should learn from the pseudonymity of Satoshi Nakamoto, it's that it does not matter if you're responding to an apparition or the material form; it is only the conversation and our impact that matters. So first I have some words for our adversary.


To The Attacker,

You are as vile as you are clever. It is my belief you never intended to receive these funds except by proxy through market manipulation, that such manipulation began weeks prior to the attack, that this is not the first time you've hurt people like this, that you've likely used this event to profit from colleagues, and that your legal posturing is merely a facade for the pleasure you derive from abusing others. You likely fit even an exaggeration of this portrait. Still, I harbor no ill will against you and truly hope you find peace from whatever it is that may torment you.

Hubris does not solely belong to you, it lands squarely on the heads of every entrepreneur that puts their ambition ahead of their compassion. Every developer that worries about their perceived authority and every investor that puts concern for user adoption rates ahead of the livelihood of regular people are solely responsible for giving you the fertile ground you needed to attack. We set the stage. That shame is on us.

Still, make no mistake, you are one who harms tens of thousands of people and disregards the fragile environment needed for scientific inquiry. You have set back the progress of technology you clearly have interest in that was born from a desire to rid the world of the same effects you're putting into it. This is your legacy. You can count yourself as clever, and probably as wealthy, but you can not count yourself a revolutionary as you exemplify the same callous violence carried out by followers of the systems we're trying to escape. It's a shame, really, that you could think Ethereum stands as an island apart from your other interests and if you are truly adversarial to these changes then your folly is even greater than I can describe.

Ultimately, the effect you have had here will fade as people return to stumbling through the dark toward a world that will render you as small as your heart. Love will always win. May you find it so you can join us in making amends. We could use your talents but leave your rancor. We have a future to build and you are presently standing on the precarious side of a determined beast you do not fully understand.

Good luck.


To the Ethereum community,

What a mess, huh? If you read my above statement you'll know I want us to address what I consider reckless behavior. It's been difficult for me to watch what I consider to be a highly unstable alpha environment used to lure millions under a pretense of production stability, and doubly difficult to watch that money get stuck in the same machine I lack resources to develop against, but thankfully my life is too awesome for me to care. You could burn all my money and I would still have everything I need and do the work I want to do. That's my privilege, and the privilege many others in this space might feel, but that is not a privilege shared by the users you so desperately want to attract. They can't fathom the waste you wave around.

It's time you take a look at the effects and not just the intent. Ethereum and similar technology with the right cultural shifts has the potential to transform our society into a utopian dream but at present it is being used for pyramid schemes, gambling, scamming, and even our best efforts are hurting people as vile creatures stalk in competing alleys waiting for a chance to demonstrate harm. There's a lot of great work being done in this space but it sucks I have to caveat myself like that because I know everyone just wants to counter each other rather than fuse our perspectives together to meet the challenge at hand.

Technology is an extension of people and their values. Math is not going to fucking save you. If you are a commentator, lurker, reporter or passive contributor I want you to recognize that you are part of the technology as you inform its direction. When you set the tone of debate to be cynical, when you cast suspicions and doubt without good reason, you poison the well of civil discourse. If you are a miner I want you to never ask Vitalik for anything because he already delivered on his promise, handed you the tool that makes his power obsolete. You can mine coins, hire developers, and convince people differently. Ethereum is yours so what are you going to do next?

Every time you turn to ""the leaders"" of Ethereum, you centralize its control by impressing upon our culture that we can't turn toward each other for answers. You also are unwittingly asking them to put their values before your own. It is not Vitalik or Ethereum that needs to decentralize, it's you. He is a fascinating and resilient person, clearly driven to this purpose, but this life is too expansive for us to obligate anyone to assume the kind of role I've seen people presume of him and other developers. People are dynamic, we have range, we are not meant for a singular purpose. Above all else, we all make mistakes and nobody owes you shit especially people whose hard work you critique with such ease.

The obsession with user adoption should come long after an obsession with developer adoption and peer review. Opportunities to fund a project should be minimal and well defined. Let there be failure and let it be small. I'm not going to tell you what I think you should do about decentralization, immutability, privacy or the many other values at play but I will say people describe these values as binaries when they are clearly on a spectrum. The values of your community will be what defines the spectrum for you, these values are for you to rewrite and you can write them in any language you know. There is no edict from protocol mountain that can help you know right from wrong but every decision you make as a community will further define it and necessarily exclude those who can't adhere to your principles.

You need to be prepared for tragedy. You need to know where you stand before the chaos of an event like this happens because the environment is intentionally cultivated and exploited by those like The Attacker to tilt your hand against yourself. Trust is not an evil unto itself and, in fact, if we can't trust each other to have compassion then we are truly lost for there is no mathematical principle that will keep you warm at night when the cold wraith of rational error comes for you.

Good luck.


Forever in space,

2517,ethereum,A hard-fork is the libertarian option!,"What's all the fuss about?

The thief can keep his loot on his chain and individual users can choose to fork their chains and undo the thief's exploit. 

A hard-fork is perfectly consistent with libertarian fundamentals so long as it's not forced on anyone - it's a choice every user/node makes.

There's no contracts being broken, no one is being forced to upgrade and fork, and no ones taking away anyones loot. 

If you want to live on the chain where the thief controls 15% of the supply, you can. If you want to provide goods and services for his stolen loot, you can! Those of us who find this idea reprehensible, don't have to. As free libertarians, we can individually choose to upgrade our nodes and fork our local chains and undo the thief's exploit.  

It's like if a bank robber manages to steal 15% of USD currency and we choose to use AUD instead. We're not stealing the bank robbers money by choosing to use another currency, he can keep his loot all he wants. And if you want to accept it for goods and services, you can!

2525,ethereum,Forking Ethereum,"It seems to me that Ethereum can have the best of both worlds here.

How?

Fork, roll back all DAO-related transactions and/or blacklist The Attacker's address, **while simultaneously making a superficial change to the Proof of Work algorithm**.

This would effectively create two distinct Ethereum networks. One would include the rollback and blacklisting, and the other would not. The two chains could peacefully coexist side-by-side.

Unlike in Bitcoin, where having one universal shared ledger is all-important, Ethereum does not actually require this. There can be 2 different EVMs, both perfectly valid and executing as intended, operating side-by-side. Money is dependent on the network effect, but ether was never designed to be money. It's perfectly fine (and actually healthy competition!) for there to be multiple EVMs for users to choose from. 

This would also help with scaling by doubling total capacity. 

I don't see any downsides to this idea. It would basically allow everyone to get what they want; if you want a smart-contract platform that is immutable, faithful to the code as written, and which doesn't involve protocol-level blacklisting/politics, simply choose to use the chain where the rollback never occurred. If you'd like to seize back the DAO funds from The Attacker, you can choose to use the chain where it did. Everybody wins!

When the trash bin in Steve's office wasn't regularly emptied, he'd ask the janitor why. A perfectly acceptable reason would be: ""Well, the door lock was changed &amp; I didn't have the key""

As a janitor, he's allowed to have excuses.

Somewhere between janitor and CEO, excuses stop mattering. As CEO, everything is your fault.

All we've heard from Stephan Tual and Slock.it are excuses. They're the leaders of The DAO. But now they're barely playing the role of janitor, leaving the Ethereum community to clean up their mess.

If you raise over $100MM, market your tech as safe (even through Facebook ads) and a hacker steals it, **it is your fault**.

If a bank manager learned of a bug with the *slightest* chance of losing customer money, he/she'd have people working around the clock to fix it. Slock.it knew of this bug in advance, but arrogantly dismissed the possibility of fund loss instead of having devs stay up all night to fix it.

This is the internet, this is crypto. **If there is an attack vector, it's not a matter of who will attack, but when the attack will happen**. We should hunt down the hacker, but frankly, if it wasn't him it would have been someone else. It was inevitable—finger pointing won't change that.

If Google or Facebook had a bug that leaked everyone's personal information to a hacker, who would you blame? IMO, not the hacker.

Stephan Tual and Slock.it haven't shown one ounce of contrition.

2530,ethereum,My solution to #TheDao impasse.,"1. Create a new (and properly vetted, this time) smart contract which will release an agreed and appropriate sum to the hacker.

For the sake of argument, let’s say $1 million, which (it could be argued) is a just reward for his ingenuity and attention to detail.

2. Create another smart contract (or use the same one?) to release the rest of the funds back to an escrow account (assuming that the total investment was $160 million, then $159 million will be returned).

Therefore less than one percent (0.625 percent) has been ‘lost’ to the hacker.

3. These losses will be spread on a pro rata basis across all the investors in The Dao.

For example, if you put in $100, you get back $99.375.

4. Refund the investors through yet another (properly vetted) smart contract and then close down The Dao permanently.

Advantages:

Fund are unfrozen.

The hacker walks away with a reward but relinquishes all claims on the rest of the funds.

Everyone else walks aways with an almost full refund.

MOST IMPORTANTLY:

No roll back (fork) is necessary.

No disastrous precedent is set and the integrity of the Ethereum blockchain is preserved.

The efficacy of properly designed and vetted smart contracts is proved.

We can all move forward and learn from the mistakes that were made.

PS. I do realise that the hacker ‘made it away’ with ‘only’ $50 million of the total $160 million or so invested in The Dao but the precise numbers are not the most important aspect of my proposed solution. Someone else can do the exact calcuations.",1466496014

2546,ethereum,The future of smart contract,"How to avoid in the future the kind of problem we encounter actually?

I think Asimov's three laws of robotics can be a really good inspiration. The idea is to make simple supreme, fondamental and immutable rules for smart contracts. Here is the three laws of robotic:

1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.

Or

1. A tool must not be unsafe to use. Hammers have handles and screwdrivers have hilts to help increase grip. It is of course possible for a person to injure himself with one of these tools, but that injury would only be due to his incompetence, not the design of the tool.
2. A tool must perform its function efficiently unless this would harm the user. This is the entire reason ground-fault circuit interrupters exist. Any running tool will have its power cut if a circuit senses that some current is not returning to the neutral wire, and hence might be flowing through the user. The safety of the user is paramount.
3. A tool must remain intact during its use unless its destruction is required for its use or for safety. For example, Dremel disks are designed to be as tough as possible without breaking unless the job requires it to be spent. Furthermore, they are designed to break at a point before the shrapnel velocity could seriously injure someone (other than the eyes, though safety glasses should be worn at all times anyway)


As I mentioned in many of my last 48h posts, I think smart contracts will succeed an be well adopted if we adapt these rules and if the actual elegant and smart governance (Foundation, Programmers, Miners, Token holders) evolve in a more balanced way with clear definition and separation of the powers and functions, to avoid arbitrary and conflict of interest. This is, in my opinion, the only way to mass adoption, trust and confidence.

While we looked at other classes of bugs than the one talked about this past week, I think (without looking closer yet) that a model such as ours could be extended to eliminate these bugs too. The concept of expressive and strong type systems and compile-time safety is really the solution here.

TL;DR: Solidity is way too low-level and unsafe for the kinds of applications being built on Ethereum. Languages more suitable can absolutely be implemented for the EVM.",1466510940

The ""death"" of bitcoin has been proclaimed numerous times.[189] One journalist has recorded 29 such ""obituaries"" as of early 2015.[189] Forbes magazine declared bitcoin ""dead"" in June 2011,[190] followed by Gizmodo Australia in August 2011.[191] Wired magazine wrote it had ""expired"" in December 2012.[192] Ouishare Magazine declared, ""game over, bitcoin"" in May 2013,[193] and New York Magazine stated bitcoin was ""on its path to grave"" in June 2013.[194] Reuters published an ""obituary"" for bitcoin in January 2014.[195] Street Insider declared bitcoin ""dead"" in February 2014,[196] followed by The Weekly Standard in March 2014,[197] Salon in March 2014,[198] Vice News in March 2014,[199] and Financial Times in September 2014.[200] In January 2015, USA Today states bitcoin was ""headed to the ash heap"",[201] and The Telegraph declared ""the end of bitcoin experiment"".[202] In January 2016, former bitcoin developer Mike Hearn called bitcoin a ""failed project"".[203]

2610,ethereum,Food for Thought: Smart Contract Recognition in the Legal System (Fractional Ownership of Artwork),"I would like to see more discussion on how smart contracts will work in conjunction with the existing legal system and therefore become more useful in the physical world. I believe a good place to start is with a simple example of fractional ownership in a work of art and how one could structure such an arrangement more efficiently with smart contracts -- there are of course many legal questions to be answered and perhaps precedents to be created (note: I am NOT a lawyer).  

Let's buy a painting! (Theoretically for now)

http://www.rauantiques.com/item/falaise-by-claude-monet.30-2984.html

Here we have a painting listed for $4.95M, first let's buy it the ""old"" way...

Traditional Approach to Fractional Ownership (please correct me if anything is wrong) --
1) Incorporate and issue shares based on capital contribution.
2) Corporation opens a bank account.
3) Corporation designates a purchasing agent.
4) Purchase asset.
5) Store/Insure asset at expense of shareholders.
6) Sell asset and distribute proceeds to shareholders.
7) Close bank account and dissolve corporation.

Now, let's look at how this could be improved by using an Ethereum smart contract and what challenges would need to be overcome...

1) Create fixed # of tokens that represent fractional ownership in a proposed purchase.
2) Sell tokens.
3) **Incorporate and have the online entity holding the tokens be legally recognized as the only shareholder of the corporation.**
4) Token-holders vote for and designate a purchasing agent.
5) Open a bank account in the name of the corporation and convert ETH raised from token sale to fiat and deposit funds in account.
6) Purchase asset.
7) Store/Insure asset by either diluting current token-holders with an additional sale or have reserves already set aside for this purpose.
8) Sell asset, convert fiat proceeds to ETH, distribute ETH to token-holders.
9) Dissolve corporation and close bank account.
10) Destroy Tokens

Obviously the big problem is point #3 ""Incorporate and have the online entity holding the tokens be legally recognized as the only shareholder of the corporation."" This is as simple of an example as I could think of in order to highlight the importance of aligning the will of token-holders with the current legal environment they will have to operate in. So I put it to the crowd!  Legally, how can this be done?  Who knows, maybe we'll all own a Monet soon!

Here in my garage...

For those of you still struggling through college or still young and working for minimum wage, I thought I'd share my little story. Shit, you might just be 15 years old and don't have any money at all. (Like me when I was a teen) Now one thing I like to tell younger people straight away is **""Fuck Retail""** I then go on to explain that, if you're working your way through college and just scraping by, you'll easily make a lot more in a serving position. Be it a bar tender or waiter, you're going to make a lot more than you would standing behind a counter at a gas-station/shop making **X amount - 1/3 in taxes**. (Unless you're one of those kids who insists they have insurance which is offered by their company)

So you bust your ass over a long weekend waiting on tables. You survive Fish Fry Friday and you managed to make it through both the slow and busy hours of Saturday and Sunday. Now it's Monday morning and you've got a few hundred dollars cash. It won't fit in your wallet because it's mostly singles.

Now do yourself a favor: Spend that money on a tradeskill! Go to college or pick up a book that's going to get you into your career! Maybe buy yourself a guitar or a violin so you can practice music in your spare time!

BUT: Take three dollars or so and put it in you bank account - And buy some Dogecoin! Personally, I used weselldoges. Bought a few thousand Dogecoin every week determined to get one million. The most difficult part was getting Paypal setup. (Which took more time than actual work)

These days I've been sitting on that million and buying more to do promotional giveaways for my [show](https://youtu.be/vS1Yg5G2ZQM). I also don't wait on tables anymore thanks to learning a necessary tradeskill through school and books.

So cheers to all you hardworking shibes trying to make a future for yourselves - as well as all the hardworking young men I've met over the years busting their ass working for a better future!

2622,ethereum,It's all about being consistent with our vision and values.,"We've been selling an idyllic portrait of Ethereum (of Todays Ethereum at least):
- Technically false: Trustless.
- Oversold idea: Anyone can code, read and sign digital contracts that will be executed as expected.

After theDAO attack we **must adjust our pitch**: 

- Ethereum (and Bitcoin) is not trustless, but the trust is ensured by a consensus which behavior is assumed honest via economic incentives. But this consensus can act as an arbitrary third party, representative of a tyranny of the majority .
- It is not easy to read a smart contract, and hard to audit it fully before signing. We are creating a super elite class: contract readers.

Forking: It would reveal the truth about the fake trustless property while showing our commitment to our vision of a place where peers and dApps could contract amongst themselves safely. The trustless property is our marketing secret sauce, hard to move on without it.

Not Forking: It would keep us protected against ""your blockchain ain't one"" but would actually hide the truth about consensus' power. (i.e It is not because we don't create a precedent that it is not possible in the future)
It would also show that our vision is a long term one and that for now smart contracts space is the Far West and Solidity devs are cowboys. Very hard to market this exclusive network too.

Now let's be honest: 
-Even if we could build one, we cannot have a trustless (forkless) blockchain for now: We still need to improve the protocol with forks.
-We know nothing about smart contracts, no best practices, no history. It is not currently a safe and public space for anyone.
-We want to experiment fast and learn faster.
-We need to stay inclusive, attract talents, initiatives and keep going.
-Ethereum is still in a beta release.

Assuming that our core values are transparency, equality in access to fair services (and not decentralization for decentralization), P2P notarized services empowerment, here are what I think would be welcomed by everyone but the Foundation devs that would have more work (If this is possible).

1. For a limited period of time, while the protocole and smart contracts dev practices are being improved, we could allow exceptional right to SF/HF in reaction to attacks. To have access to this right, a letter of intention in English should be published when the contract is created on the mainnet. Fees could be asked and redirected to a group in charge of security development.
=&gt; This would allow us to experiment fast and big.
=&gt; This would allow us to stay true to our core value ""We create immutable contracts"" (instead of immutable automatically executed pieces of code)

2. This limited period of time ends with an update to the protocole which strengthen its resistance to the tyranny of majority (Forks)
=&gt; This would allow us to have a trustless property even stronger than Bitcoin's
=&gt;  At that time we would comply with our two strong values: A trustless technology fair and inclusive.",1466525598

It's not like he's going to do anything untoward with the money, and it's all out in the open on the blockchain.

Pros:

* The DAO finally passes a proposal.
* It's a completely normal, legitimate action. The DAO has a right to send its ether to whomever it wants.
* Quick and easy
* Vitalik comes out a hero, and the clever action makes headlines. Ethereum comes out victorious and unscathed.

Cons:

2640,ethereum,I have lost so much money...,"Ever since I got a ""real"" job and started being able to put away a little money for investing, I have made and lost (but mostly lost), a LOT of money over the years.  

I have lost money on stocks, options, derivatives, and who knows what else.  I lost money due to asshole CEOs not doing their jobs, bullshit product lines, the media overhyping bad companies, and companies being obsoleted by new technologies.  

Lately I have been investing in crypto-related projects.  When the hype for Slock.it started building (with the huge help from the Ethereum team), I strongly considered investing in it.  I gave it a lot of thought and ultimately decided there was too much risk and basically impossible for this project to make money without something going wrong along the way, and I put my money elsewhere.  In the real world, I would be rewarded for this decision, and those who went the other way would be punished.

The people who bought Slock.it invested in a bad project that failed because the leaders left $120 million hanging by a vulnerability in a smart contract, and these investors are now shocked that they will probably lose that money.

Can anyone explain to me why those who made the poor decision to support this crappy project are being handed a second chance?  What lesson are these newbie investors being taught here?  How do you expect the market for cryptocurrencies to operate if you are going to interfere with it?

2650,ethereum,"Enough already with the word ""community""","I'm sick and tired of the word ""community"" coming from the pro-fork crowd.  It is a very similar word to communism for a reason.  It's a collectivist rather than an individualist word.  And, it is being used, like communism, to collectivize assets, to excuse fools from taking responsibility for their actions and to violate individual property rights.

""Community"" will now be used to collectively freeze all the assets of the entire DAO, not just the hacked portion.  Then, ""Community"" will be used take all those assets and do something that benefits the ""community"".  

There is no community.  There are only individuals.  But there are individuals who will use the concept of community  to attempt to manipulate or force other individuals into involuntary actions.  

There is a revolution underway in Ethereum, by communityists, to take over and supersede the mechanics of the system that were very carefully chosen.  The justification they offer is ""consensus is whatever the majority decides"".  That is a lie.  If 51% of people want something that does not imply consensus.  

The consensus rule of blockchains is simply that all nodes agree that the longest chain is the valid one.  There is no rule that a majority can take the ether of an individual or a minority.  But that is explicitly what the communityists are saying is true.  How much worse a hack is that - that a majority can steal from a minority - than what's happened to the dao?  The pro fork side claims that all the promises of trustlessness, decentralization, immutability, etc.. should be thrown away because the hacker violated the intention of the DAO.  Instead they say, we should violate the intention of the whole blockchain as an immutable ledger of transactions.  It is plain and simple to see which hack is of greater proportion and is worse. 

It doesn't end at the DAO.  It is a precedent that will be called for again and again by a group calling themselves ""the community.""   Always they will be looking for ""community justice"".  Always they will be violating the principles of the right to personal property, which is the whole reason crypto currencies and Ethereum were developed.",1466533068

(The fate of ethereum is in the Hands of The Miners),"The 'exodus' of Ethereum miners which has been progressively worsening the past few days is exactly what we don't need right now - considering the fast approaching miner referendum in which miners will decide the response to the DAO hack, if any at all.


Many have strong views in this debate, and great discussions are going on within the Ethereum community as I type this, however, at the end of the day no-matter the consensus of the community - it’s the miners vote that count. The recent downsizing of miners combined with the imminent referendum has created a doubly whammy of sorts, creating a crisis situation - worse, this situation is hardly being talked about.


As many of you know, the fate of the network is resting solely in the hands of those mining Ethereum in the coming days, they will decide whether we soft-fork, hard-fork, no-fork, and whatever else the community may propose. I’ve spoken to a few in-the-know people on the matter and they have related to my concerns that big money / whale miners could effectively decide the outcome of the vote due to a majority percentage of network hash power - effectively thwarting the will of the consensus. 

The only viable way to deter this from happening is for there to be an influx of individual miners to vote on referendum day. This is a call to arms of all-importance. If you believe in the currency, I cant encourage you enough to take part, (even if you own a not-so-good computer, I'm using a 500$ dell laptop), the more individual miners on the network to vote, the better the chance of an outcome being reached in the best interest of the consensus. More important then generating daily Ethereum, (which could be worth a fortune in the future) you're helping the network where &amp; when she needs you most, in the most invaluable of ways.. If you believe in Ethereum, or have an opinion on the course of action the network should take, there's little better you can do then to take part in mining in the coming days. The importance of getting involved cant be overstated enough, this is a precedent setting event, history making without a doubt - the greatest test to Ethereum, or all crypto currencies for that matter. 

The will of the community at whole must not be thwarted by the top echelon, only through wide participation can overcome, heed Ethers call to arms brETHren!

For those new to mining, there are two pools i'd recommend [Ethminer](https://ethermine.org) and [Minergate](https://minergate.co). I prefer the latter for it's ease of use, simple adjustment of CPU/GPU dedicated to mining enabling an absence of lag.

2689,ethereum,What have YOU learnt from 'the Great DAO Heist'?,"What I have learnt:

1) This is a great, adaptive, learning community that could be the saving grace of this project and blockchains in general as we sail into uncharted waters (see my fears below). 

2) We need better tools to communicate and engage in intelligent discourse with and reach consensus then are currently available today.

3) Ultimately, a blockchain is held together by it's community consensus - always has been, and hopefully always will be.

4) You get the power to choose your blockchain (community). If you are unhappy to the extent you want to split, fork and create your own blockchain/community or choose one whose rules you want to live by.


And now for the scary bit: We can't uninvent blockchains and IMO they will play an increasingly important part in the future... not necessarily in the de-centralised way we hope though:


In my opinion Ethereum and Smart Contracts as configured is probably the most powerful Centralising tool yet invented (the complete anti-thesis of Decentralisation), with the ability to concentrate huge power and influence to a greater extent than has existed before into fewer hands with the least amount of effort - to the detriment of thousands and and in future maybe millions of others. This DAO heist siphoning millions of dollars representing many thousands of hours of effort from large numbers of people - trivially and anonymously achieved with a few lines of code over a few hours - is  a case in point. Imagine a future where more critical DAPPs such as countrywide voting mechanisms, Infrastructure and Utility DAPPS, IOT applications etc that could be similarly subverted by someone or some group acting maliciously and anonymously - with zero accountability...

The solution to this 'Centralisation' problem I am concerned will not come about with just building safeguards around Smart Contracts to make them ""safer"" - there can never be ultimate guarantees in software that will require changes over time and the stakes for introducing errors will be too high. Something more radical will be required - my prediction is no less then the end of anonymity on mission critical public DAPPS and perhaps even the entire public blockchain.

2701,ethereum,The decision is in the Pool operators' hands,"So far, three pool operators can decide whether or not we soft fork:

https://etherchain.org/statistics/miners

With so many people using a pool, the pool operators technically have decision making power over Ethereum's future. Since a soft fork requires an overwhelming consensus of miners (51%) to agree, we need to make sure pool operators represent that consensus correctly.

First, a big thank you to ethpool/ethermine for giving us real data to work with. Let's use it as an example: http://ethermine.org/stats/votes

According to the data, it would seem that an overwhelming majority of their users want the soft fork. 67640 Mh/s voted yes, 14286 Mh/s voted no and 1124 Mh/s voted don't care, at the time of this writing. That's 81.4% who voted yes, which is *waaay* bigger than 51%... right? 

Unfortunately no. **Only 18%** of their total user base has actually voted. This means that only 18% care enough to vote (right now), and only 14.6% care enough to vote yes. This number is much less than the 51% required by the network, since ""not voting"" is equivalent to a no vote.[1]

When installing the soft fork onto their machines, we need to make sure our pool operators accurately represent this voting structure. If they don't, then we're letting a small handful of people decide the future of our protocol.

To put this in perspective, here are a few conclusions that would be incorrect when looking at ethpool's data:

- ""An overwhelming majority want a soft fork"". This is incorrect because only 14.6% care enough to vote yes, which means only 14.6% would care enough to install the fork.
- ""The users that have voted represent the wider network."" ethpool accounts for 20.8% of the network's mining power, and only 14.6% of their users have voted yes. Extrapolating that out, this means that ethpool's yes votes account for just above 3% of the network, which is hardly significant.
- ""Not voting or voting 'don't care' is equivalent to ambivalence, and those votes shouldn't be counted."" This is against the spirit of the network. The network suggests that you need an overwhelming majority to act, and in ethpool's case only 14.6% have said they'd take this required action.

Please put pressure on our mining pools to accurately represent your votes. If you don't, it's very easy for a handful of pool operators and a small, caring minority to sway the state of the network. Especially if we set a precedent for forks like these in the future, we'll want to be absolutely sure we're free from manipulation.

Disclaimer: I happily mine with ethermine.org. I have 170 Mh/s hash power. I'd like my vote counted correctly.

--------------

[1] Were this solo mining, the network requires you to physically install the soft fork in order have a yes vote counted. Not installing is equivalent to ""no"", and the protocol only cares if 51% of total users install.

2704,ethereum,Observations on DAO and Ethereum,"1. Blaming the Solidity language or Ethereum for the execution of a contract with unintended consequences is like blaming a spell checker for not correcting the misuse of the wrong word in a document even though it correctly spelled the word. EVM prevents the submission of code which may have execution errors, but it does not and should not attempt to interpret and check the design intent of the contract.

2. The contract created by the DAO attacker would be unenforceable in a court of law since one of the requirements of a contract is that it must give consideration to both parties. The contract written by the attacker is 100% biased towards the attacker with absolutely no consideration given to the other party, the other DAO token holders.

3. People tend to assume anarchism means a lack of governance. This is not the case. Anarchism allows multiple forms of governance to peacefully coexist, in which individuals can voluntarily chose in which to participate. The current means by which the Ethereum ecosystem is countering the attack is a perfect example of how governance works in a free society. When the attacker decided to participate in this ecosystem, he agreed to the rules by which it operates, including the option of the miners to change the code which they run as they see fit, with the majority of hash power determining the outcome.

4. By threatening legal action against miners who agree to fork to protect the attacker's intended victims, the attacker is ultimately threatening the miners with violence.",1466549237

2710,ethereum,Update on the White Hat attack,"I hope that I'll be able to write down a more complete blog post at some point, because the full story would make a fascinating read, but right now here's are the main points:

Since Friday I've been in contact with a group of very smart people with the intent on replicating the attack to avoid any more of the ether being bled. Let's call this group, collectively ""Robin Hood"". Everyone in this group acted as an individual and did not represent or received the endorsements of their employers.

Robin had been able to replicate the attack on the testnet but couldn't be sure it would work until it was tested. First it would require the group to successfully stalk and infiltrate multiple split proposals that were open.

After some initial setbacks the group was able to infiltrate all open split proposals and trying to identify the best one to execute. 

The best candidate proposal ended up being [#78](http://etherscan.io/token/thedao-proposal/78) because it didn't have many stalkers and we had identified the curator. We control 3 of the 5 accounts that split with us, if you have any information on who are the other accounts, please contact us so we are able protect the funds.

The group was diverse in their opinions on the fork(s). Some are very strongly anti-any-fork, some are very strong pro-fork and everything in between. Despite our differences, we identified an imminent attack we worked together to prevent it. For that reason everyone was also reticent on doing the White Hat Attack as it could be bad for the recovery efforts on the past hacks. Also, even those in the group that supported the soft fork could agree that we had no idea how long it would take to implement and deploy one.

Today about 19h central european time Robin detected that there was a new attack going on. It was draining slowly, a few ether per round, but it had already amassed a few thousand dollars. It seemed to be someone testing the waters and seeing if it could drain more.

Having our hands forced, the group decided to go forwards with the attack. I donated 100k dao tokens to the process with the full knowledge that it could be burned in the process. The more tokens the Robin contract had, the faster it could syphon the ether to protect it. The attacker picked up the pace and other attackers joined in. Some of the most efficient hackers were able to do up to 30 recursions with up to 200 ether moved in each, so it became clear that if we didn't do anything the DAO would be drained before anything could have been done.

We contacted some ""whales"" who were happy to donate to the effort and we were able to secure about 6M DAO tokens. We made it clear to everyone that we were not sure they would be able to recover these tokens, but these generous friends were happy to contribute to the effort. Thanks to this we were able to outpace the attacker, doing 4,000 and then at up to 40,000 ether per round, totaling up30 rounds of recursions.

All these attacks [can be studied on the blockchain]( http://etherscan.io/txsinternal?zero=true&amp;a=0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413&amp;valid). This is the [child DAO of the Robin Hood attack](
https://etherscan.io/address/0xb136707642a4ea12fb4bae820f03d2562ebff487).

These three child daos were the ones in which a concurrent attack drained ether: [84ef](http://etherscan.io/address/0x84ef4b2357079cd7a7c69fd7a37cd0609a679106), [f4c6](http://etherscan.io/address/0xf4c64518ea10f995918a454158c6b61407ea345c) and [aeeb](
http://etherscan.io/address/0xaeeb8ff27288bdabc0fa5ebb731b6f409507516c). We know nothing about them and if any of these are parallel white hat attacks then this is the right time to come forward. If you happen to be the curator of any of these child daos, or happened to have split with them into one of them, please come forward as well do come forward as well as you can help with this effort. There might be others.

### What now?

7.2M ethers from the DAO are now  held in a child DAO and we hold the private keys of the curator. It's important to identify the other 2  - but the risk has been reduced from 20 thousand attackers down to only 2. As soon as that DAO matures, we will try to move all the funds in a refund contract, that will be much simpler than the DAO was. Of course we still need to be very careful with that code and to analyze it for any possible exploit.

If you own the addresses **0xb97ba16dfafa8fc5824c029f0653cc03a1796e99** or **0xe1e278e5e6bbe00b2a41d49b60853bf6791ab614** please come forward.

There is a lot of unaccounted ether, on the main attacker dao and other copycat attacks. If you are the curator in any of them, you might be very useful. If you are the hacker, then all I can say is we are coming for you. There are many [plans in place to attack the child daos and either block the funds or recover them](https://blog.slock.it/a-dao-counter-attack-613548408dd7).

### What about forks? 

I've made my opinion clear many times about my opposition to a hard fork that breaks code or balance immutability, so I don't think this is the place to discuss it. 

The child daos are also vulnerable to the same kinds of attacks so it's important to identify everyone else on the same child dao as the main whitehat. There are very valid points for a limited, voluntary, temporary software upgrade in which miners will be able to prevent other attacks like this from happening, and they may be used to prevent further attacks on these child DAOs. We now hope we bought enough time to stay calm and rational about these.


### What about what's left in the DAO?

There are still plans to retrieve the remainder of the DAO and I can't discuss it further. But most of the ether is now more secure and there are some interesting advantages on having some money left [which will allow the DAO itself to buy tokens into the bad splits and attack them to recover or block the ether](https://blog.slock.it/a-dao-counter-attack-613548408dd7#.sthdgppgx).

2711,ethereum,How will mining pools decide?,"Some pools are holding votes. However it seems that a lot of miners are not voting. Will the decision be left up to those that vote?

If so I think that is entirely unfair as any fork should be an explicit opt-in. The reason being is that no blockchain rules should change for you without your explicit permission.

The argument the entire time has been that the decision is up to the miners. The miners need to switch software to support the mining operation, which is an explicit operation. Likewise on a pool the same should hold, if the miner does not explicitly want the change then it shouldn't change.

By all means if your pool has &gt;50% voting yes then go ahead with supporting the fork. But otherwise I believe it is unfair to automatically opt-in those not explicitly participating.

2726,ethereum,implementing a fail-safe mechanism into smart contracts that would make the community arbitration possible without forks.,"I was thinking that one possible way to learn from recent events is to implement a smart contract mechanism that would give the community (possibly represented by their stake in Ethereum) power to overrule or nullify any activity related to the contract or at least any activity that happened recently enough.

Users of future smart contracts would weight the risk of possible flaws in the contract's code against the risk of community meddling in their business and choose to either implement the clause or not. That way we could avoid the present dilema in the future by providing a voluntary mechanism of preemptively managing the risk.

edit: 1) Because there is some confusion, I want to clarify that this would be a purely optional feature (it would be implemented as a smart contract) and its main goal is to prevent any future forks by letting people explicitly decide beforehand if they want to use ""hard"" or ""soft"" contracts. In other words, it is a tool to protect proponents of immutability too.

2727,ethereum,"This online exchange I recently had shows the lackadaisical attitude and irrelevant arguments of a Solidity language designer who apathetically acquiesces in the pitfalls of the procedural paradigm. Followed by a 20-minute video showing the actual state of the art, of which he is apparently unaware.","https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4opjov/the_bug_which_the_dao_hacker_exploited_was_not/d4ge4lp

This procedural programmer has no sense of priorities or urgency: Note how he irrelevantly mentions being able to ""go right down into the assembly"" as if it were some kind of benefit instead of actually [being a borderline bug](http://www.loper-os.org/?p=55).

And the most damning thing of all is that he makes his arguments apparently blissfully unaware of the state of the art of the industry in which he is attempting to operate (smart contract language design) - which is magnificently on display in the following inspiring 20-minute video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeg_Q5uN73Q

(You can ignore the brief video-within-a-video towards the beginning, which had bad audio.)

The languages used in that 20-minute video are *not* procedural, they are **functional**.

And as the video shows, the finance industry knows that the important thing in smart contract language design is *not* whether you're able to dip into the underlying assembly language. 

**The most important thing in smart contract language design is *provable correctness*.**

Until we start designing contracts using functional languages - which are the only languages that support automated formal **program verification** to prove that a contract is ""correct"" before running it (ie, that it satisfies a certain specification or certain invariants, or never gets into certain 'prohibited' states), then these kinds of totally avoidable disasters and debates (the draining of the DAO, and the dilemma of what to do about it) will unfortunately continue to happen again and again.

Now, due to certain technical aspects of language design (which I try to explain below in the section further below, called **How can we make programming as perfect as math?**), **program verification** can effectively *only* be done by using *functional* languages - mainly because functional languages prohibit the arbitrary *side-effects* and *control flow jumps* that make it practically infeasible to symbolically traverse the entire [Kripke structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kripke_structure_%28model_checking%29) of all of a program's possible future behaviors - ie the (possibly infinite) time-branching *semantics* of the contract's state space, as expressed by its (finitely presented) code or *syntax*.

**Mathematics and markets**

Verifying a program is equivalent to proving a theorem. 

Everyone knows that for all right triangles, a^2 + b^2 = c^2 is always true - and we know this because we have a mathematical proof of this. 

In fact, we also know that every single thing in the entire edifice of mathematics is also always true - again because we only allow things to be added if we have a mathematical proof that they are true.

The question humanity is facing right now is serious but simple: **Do we want our markets to be governed by the perfection of mathematics (which is always right), or by the apathy and unawareness of procedural programmers** (who think it's fine to be wrong, as long as [they apologize politely afterwards to the community](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4p521a/to_the_community/))?

Mathematicians never have to write blog posts or tweets saying ""Sorry, I fucked up"" - because they're not allowed to submit *any* work product that isn't accompanied by mathematical proof of its correctness.

Software developers doing procedural programming, on the other hand, are held to a much lower standard. They routinely ship buggy code. This is because there is no tradition of requiring mathematical proof that their code is correct. But this is a socio-political problem which can easily be remedied, by simply requiring that *programming* be held to the same standards of proof that *mathematics* is. 

**How can we make programming as perfect as math?**

The answer is somewhat subtle, but simple: We must use *functional* languages, which are the only languages which support **program verification**. 

Note that most of mathematics is generally *not* procedural - it is typically *equational* (which is actually similar to being *functional*).

When solving an equation in mathematics, you usually don't say: ""assign this value to this variable"" or ""go to this location"". In other words, when solving an equation in mathematics, there is no variable assignment and there is no control flow. Instead, you just keep applying a certain kind of transformation over and over again - in this case, ""doing the same thing"" to both sides of the equation.

It doesn't really matter *what* you to to both sides, as long as you do the *same thing* to both sides. (In fact, this class of transformations constitute a nice example of *a language which is restricted but sufficiently powerful to do the job*.)

Of course, when reducing an equation, it is normally recommended that you should have a strategy in mind: ie instead of aimlessly applying random transformations (which you *could* do if you wanted to, without ever changing the ""truthfulness"" of the equational term), you are instead advised to strategically choose do to precisely those transformation which will eventually isolate the *x* on one side: and then you're done. 

Notice that in all of this process you actually never ""assign"" a value to a ""variable"", and you never have to ""go to"" a particular predetermined ""place"".

You instead treat the equation *as a whole*, and you keep attacking it as a whole, transforming it into another whole, until that whole is in a form that you like, which you consider to be the ""solution"". 

It doesn't even matter what order you do the operations in. You might choose to first subtract the same thing from both sides, and then divide both sides by the same thing - or you could just as easily reverse the order of these transformations - and you'd still ultimately get the same result. (This is an important property of mathematics and functional programming, called ""convergence"".)

And finally, no ""exceptions"" can ever occur, because the set of transformations which you're allowed to apply - ie, your ""programming language"" - is so restricted (you're only allowed to ""do the same thing to both sides"") that nothing you could ever do could even ""throw"" an ""exception"".

**Functional programming is based on mathematics. Procedural programming *looks* like it is, but actually it isn't.**

Solving an equation (ie, reducing an ""equational term"") is similar to the way functional programs work. 

Unlike procedural programs, functional programs usually don't need to assign different values to variables, and they don't have much of a notion of a sequential control flow where you ""go to"" any particular location - determined in advance, or determined by a test.

Sometimes it might *seem* like you have to ""go to"" a particular place in the code of a functional program - but this is just an illusion. For example, you may have noticed that most functional languages usually do have a construct saying ""if ... then ... else ... endif"" - just like most procedural languages.

But there is a major (but subtle) difference! The functional version of that construct is actually already a *value* (and there is no assignment going on, and you don't have to ""go to"" a particular location). Meanwhile the procedural version of that construct is a ""control statement"" which doesn't have a value of its own - instead, its semantics (behavior) depends on producing side effects (assignments to variables) or making the program's control flow ""go to"" a particular place.

By the way, for anyone that uses functions in Excel: the ""=IF()"" function in Excel is *functional*, not *procedural*! It ""is"" its own result, which gets slotted into the overall term within the cell. Excel is actually a very good example of a functional language - which should be encouraging news to any procedural programmers who think that functional programming might be difficult!

So in functional programming you just keep doggedly applying certain transformations pretty much anywhere you want within a term, until that term is eventually reduced to a simplifed form which you recognize as the ""solution"". There is a simplicity and a unity, a timelessless and a placelessness, in mathematics and functional programming - unlike the sequentiality and locationality of the imperative style of procedural programming, with its unnecessary, distracting and confusing additional bookkeeping involving ""update this value"" and ""go to this location"". 

By contrast, notice that the ""value"" of an equation (or of a term being reduced in a functional program) never actually changes - since you're only allowed to apply operations which *reduce* (simplify) it, never *update* it. Likewise the notion of ""sequential execution"" in solving equations and functional programming is also irrelevant: you are free to reduce (simplify) *any* location within the term, in any order - because all possible reduction paths are guaranteed to eventually converge on the same solution.

What all this means is that functional programs are much simpler than procedural ones - because there's so much less to keep track of. There are vastly fewer actual different ""states"" in which a functional program can ""be"": values never get re-""assigned"", and control never has to ""go to"" any particular location. Instead, permitted transformations can arbitrarily be applied anywhere, usually even in parallel, and in the end all the various possible sequential paths of possible transformations which can actually occur are guaranteed to eventually converge on the same final result anyways. 

So when solving an equation in math (or reducing a term in a functional language): there's lots of equally valid paths to the final result, and lots of locations within the current equation (or term) where you can choose to apply transformations, usually even simultaneously (in parallel) - but there is no predetermined sequential flow of control, and the value of the term is the same before every transformation and after - it's just more (or less) ""reduced"".

It is precisely this simplicity of functional programming which makes it possible to perform **program verification.** (And, by the way, this simplicity is also what makes functional programming better for doing parallel or concurrent computation - which is probably something Ethereum should also be shooting for.)

**Functional programming - not procedural programming - is the right tool for writing *safe* smart contracts**

Getting back to smart contracts: if you run a **program verifier** on a smart contract, it can prove that certain things about it are ""true"" (eg, an attacker can never drain funds from it, etc.).

Just like there was a hidden flaw in ""The DAO"", there is a hidden flaw in the hype around Solidity and smart contracts and all this hot air about ""code as law"": They're selling this stuff to us as if it were as rigorous as *mathematics* - when reality it's just the usual sloppy software development that's typical of *procedural programming* - where bugs are expected, and schedule and budget overruns are the norm. (See [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4opjov/the_bug_which_the_dao_hacker_exploited_was_not/) for a bunch of examples of this lackadaisical attitude - scroll down to the section called **""More examples of failed projects and ""lethal software""**.)

As the above [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeg_Q5uN73Q) shows, for a certain restricted class of programs (which is broad enough to encompass any contract which we could possibly dream up), it is quite straightforward to pass a smart contract through a **program verifier** before running it, to check whether there are *any* 'prohibited' states which the contract might ever end up in.

This kind of **program verifier** produces one of two outputs: either ""no 'prohibited' states found"" - or it gives an counter-example: a path leading to a 'prohibited' state. 

Conceptually, such a **program verifier** just uses symbolic computation to do a brute-force combinatorial attack simulating all possible future branching paths which the program could ""go down"", trying to *refute* the proposition that ""this program can never reach a certain 'prohibited' state.""

In other words, a **program verifier** uses a ""refutational style"" to try to push the program into a 'prohibited' state - and if it manages to succeed (with the limitations of space and time you give it), then it tells you.

**People writing high-value mission-critical software are routinely doing *program verification* now**

**Program verification** is now being routinely done for all mission-critical software, in fields such as [avionics and aerospace, hardware validation, cryptographic protocols](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4p0um9/why_turingcomplete_smart_contracts_are_doomed/d4heh97), etc.

But this kind of **program verification** is *only* practical for languages without arbitrary side effects and control flow jumps - and basically this corresponds with the family of languages called ""functional"". 

This ability to perform formal reasoning and verification *before* running the program is actually the *main reason* why functional languages are for these kinds of high-value mission-critical applications.

**Procedural programmers can usually learn functional programming quite easily**

The *syntax* of a functional language doesn't look all that different from the syntax of other languages - so it's usually not a big leap for a programmer to start using functional languages. Remember, the ""if ... then ... else ... endif"" construct in the example given above looked pretty much the same in a functional language versus a procedural language (but the semantics are simpler for the functional version, making it easier to do **program verification**). 

Or, to take another example, an ""iterator"" in a functional language will typically have similar, easily recognizable ""parts"" like a ""loop"" in a proceural language - but the ""iterator"" can be treated (by **program verification** tools) as a *pure value*, while the ""loop"" must be treated as *a kind of funky rickety sequential/temporal control flow thingamajig which eventually (if it doesn't hand off control to some other faraway part of the program due to throwing an exception) destructively assigns a value.*

It is precisely this timeless, locationless simplicity of every immutable ""value"" in a functional language - versus the massive complicated sequence-dependent location-dependent complexity of most mutable ""values"" in other languages - which makes it possible to perform automated **verification of programs** written in functional languages - something which is practically impossible to do for programs written in procedural languages.

The challenge is: making procedural programmers understand *why* they need to make the simple conceptual leap to functional languages - if they want to work on high-value mission-critical projects.

**Procedural programmers doing smart contract language design need to make the leap to functional programming now.**

Most programmers fail to grasp the *feasibility* and the *necessity* of using the functional paradigm on these kinds of projects.

I think in large part they just need to realize how *feasible* **program verification** is when using a functional language - and how much safer it is compared to the semi-formal ""testing"" they sometimes use with their procedural or object-oriented languages.

Functional programming isn't much harder than procedural programming. The only real hard part is learning about monads - but there's [tons of monad tutorials out there](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=monad+tutorial&amp;ia=web), and eventually you realize that it's just a generic way of baking certain frequently occurring types of control flow and value assignments into a generic, reusable structure. The simplest example of monads - the Option - is very easy to learn first, and you will quickly appreciate how much better it is than the procedural approach of using exceptions. (Basically an Option is something which either returns a value which can be either something or nothing. This makes exception handling much easier, since it's baked right into your data.)

The procedural programmer I was talking to online mentioned that one of his colleagues favors functional languages - but the procedural guy didn't really see the value in it (even though he has used Rust.)

Many procedural programmers who have tried a functional language typically only learned the *first-order* stuff (how to write programs in it) without ever learning the *higher-order* stuff (how to formally **verify programs** written in it).

But as [the video at the start of this OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeg_Q5uN73Q) shows, being able to perform **program verification** is the real payoff of using functional languages. 

So I hope that if more procedural programmers see videos like this, they'll have that ""aha!"" moment where they see the real value of functional languages, and they'll make the leap.

**Because when it comes to high-value mission-critical projects - such as smart contract language design - the benefit of *program verification* is not ""optional"", it is *mandatory*.**

Just thinking out loud, really. OK, got that? Proceed...

So, I've been reading all these moans and groans about people not being able to buy coins, cos they're young, broke, bankless, cardless, paypalless, live in NY or whatever. This all seems to be a bigger problem in 'the land of the free' than elsewhere, so maybe we can come up with ways to help shibes out.

What if shibes who **aren't** destitute were to buy stuff from shibes who are? I don't mean doge stuff that they could just as easily get themselves, but rather things which are more geographically constrained.

For example, I'm a coin collector. Now, for the most part I collect Aussie coins, especially errors. But suppose I offered to buy US coins for Doge? Of course they would have to be uncirculated, or have errors on them, and the postage would have to be factored in. It makes no sense to spend a couple of bucks shipping ten cents across the Pacific after all. And keep in mind this is just an example. There are probably lots of things I, or someone in say Europe, might be interested in that a shibe in the states could source locally. Heck, we even have a US supermarket here that only stocks american imports. ;)

Oh, and about that NY problem... an easy fix comes to mind. I sell you a photograph or other digital work, say for five bucks. You pay me, and I then thank you for the prompt payment with a little tip here on Reddit. $5 worth of doge seems an appropriate 'thank you', no? ;) One thing has nothing to do with the other thing, see?

0. TheDAO curators whitelist darkDAO 
1. Make a proposal for TheDAO to buy a few darkDAO tokens (It can be done: https://blog.slock.it/a-dao-counter-attack-613548408dd7?gi=dcb624d0c18b#.icv7euyzu)

      a. From TheDAO to the darkDAO  
      b. From the darkDAO to TheDAO's extra balance address  
      c. From TheDAO extra balance address to a refund contract (I don't even know if the extra balance is meant to be frozen by the current soft fork)  
3. Once the proposal passes, TheDAO will have tokens of the darkDAO, it can transfer it to a white hat group to use the bug to transfer back all the funds from the darkDAO to TheDAO extra balance  
4. Vote in TheDAO to transfer the extra balance to a refund contract

1- Can any small amount of darDAO token allow to leak ALL the darkDAO?

According to the /r/Bitcoin mods, ""major"" news about other cryptocurrencies is always still allowed to be posted there.

As a result, the /r/ethereum subreddit got flooded by new reddit accounts and accounts that only used to post on /r/Bitcoin before the attack. The opinions stated by these accounts were broadly negative and insulting, not constructive or supportive.

Now, after a positive turn of events, the new ""major"" development is suddenly not newsworthy anymore on /r/Bitcoin and is being censored again by the /r/Bitcoin community.

This combination of actions and events by the /r/Bitcoin community is something that I perceive as an attack on the Ethereum community, lead by the actions of its moderators who have a history of closely influencing its followers.

There is not much that can or must be done about this, except I believe it's important for everyone involved in these communities to think whether this hostility towards each other is any good for the crypto currency space as a whole.

The /r/Bitcoin moderators have yet again proven that they are not acting in the best interest of Bitcoin, nor the crypto community as a whole and I just hope that all the people involved in this space hereby fully realize again the toxicity of the /r/Bitcoin sub.

Not much new per se, but putting theoretical facts in the context of the real world was an eye-opener for me. This is what it boils down for me.*

**Smart contracts are not smart.**
They are computer programs running on a fairly simple machine. Yes, having built and deployed the machine is a tremendous accomplishment, but it doesn’t make the programs running on it intelligent.

**Smart contracts are not contracts.**
A contract is an agreement between people. A computer program can at best be an attempt to represent such an agreement in computer code. If the code has bugs, the program might not do what the people engaged in the contract intended.

**Unstoppable applications can be stopped.**
The blockchain is not immutable. While immutability is the normal case, the rules can be changed and are being changed when the need arises. What changes are accepted is basically a community decision and depending of the nature of the change different stakeholders have a say.

**Putting lots of money under the control of a computer program was a very stupid idea.**
Not just stupid, also probably unnecessary. The goals were to jointly decide on investments, distribute the rewards and make the voting rights tradeable. All of this could be achieved without pooling all the money in one place.

**This community is awesome!**
Seeing so many people putting their money in this experiment because they want this crowdfunding / crowd investing thing to happen is a sign that a door has been opened to something very significant. Okay, so we failed in the first attempt. The software is in beta and the community maybe not even in alpha state at this point. But we are growing up and fast. The response to this attack since Friday was breathtakingly impressive. Outstanding. I take my hat off to everyone contributing to this achievement. 

Now I want to work on the next step of the evolution. And I know I’m not the only one.

Thank you Ethereum team for having made this experiment possible by building Ethereum. Thank you again for your work to help us, the DAO ""investors"", to get out of the mess we created. Also thank you slock, consensys and everybody else who contributes to resolving this.

Hello,

I'm self-admittedly new to Litecoin. I was aware of mining fees for sending Bitcoin and gas cost for sending Ether, but I didn't see an option for how to send, or if I should send extra mining fees for a transaction from the mobile wallet.

My mobile wallet is backed up and encrypted and I've read some places that I could try to load it onto a paper wallet or the lite-client on my computer, but I wanted to ask the community for advice. Should I just wait for this transaction to clear? Will it clear?

Do I have any options?

2789,ethereum,Honest question.,"After this drama recently the obvious occured to me.

If the dao can vote on proposals then it seems logical to have the following in place:

1) if there is suspicious activity recognised by the dao, (i.e. funds transfers without a corresponding ""passed proposal"") then it should enter a paused state.

2) In an emergency paused state allow the ability of the dao to vote on one of two options, resume operation, or withdraw only.

This is very basic but kind of obvious as a fail safe if you think about it.

It also takes away the responsibility of the mining community to try and fix a single application on the network as that can reduce ""application neutrality"" and endanger percieved trust in the network. 

Miners are there to be neutral, to make sure everything runs as it is coded, not dictate which applications should be changed, forked, tampered with etc. That responsibility lies with the application users not the miners, and fail safes like this put the users in control (the ones with the highest vested interest to make the correct decision for the application) not the miners.

IMO the application users will always make the best decision for the application, and the miners will always make the best decision for the network as a whole. If there are alot of miners also invested in the dao then it will fork, if not then it wont.

So its easy to see that in these early days with the dao being one of the only large apps on ethereum that there is alot of support to fork it, but going forward that will no longer be the case and it will be naieve to think that you will be able to rely on the miners/ stakers to care about an app they dont use, it would be in their interest to protect the networks neutrality and integrity over saving an app. ""If it aint broke, dont fix it"".

These types of automated fail safes should be standard practice.

Also regarding the alledged flaws in the solidity programming language, as a non technical person even I can agree with the argument that smart contracts should be written in a programming language that is as verifiably correct as math! The idea of functional languages that are provably correct (formal program verification) out weigh the advantages (if any) of procedural languages that will be near impossible to write bug-free smart contracts in.

If high-value mission-critical software is written in functional languages running formal program verification, then why are we not?

Ethereum has alot of procedural programming languages already, why not add a functional language option?",1466594903

Here's an excerpt for people that claim 'immutability/decentralization is violated by doing a soft/hard fork' and why these qualities were never a promise in the first place:

&gt; My own effort at defining the difference is as follows. DOs and DAOs are both vulnerable to collusion attacks, where (in the best case) a majority or (in worse cases) a significant percentage of a certain type of members collude to specifically direct the D*O’s activity. However, the difference is this: in a DAO collusion attacks are treated as a bug, whereas in a DO they are a feature. In a democracy, for example, the whole point is that a plurality of members choose what they like best and that solution gets executed; in Bitcoin’s on the other hand, the “default” behavior that happens when everyone acts according to individual interest without any desire for a specific outcome is the intent, and a 51% attack to favor a specific blockchain is an aberration. This appeal to social consensus is similar to the definition of a government: if a local gang starts charging a property tax to all shopowners, it may even get away with it in certain parts of the world, but no significant portion of the population will treat it as legitimate, whereas if a government starts doing the same the public response will be tilted in the other direction.

&gt; Bitcoin is an interesting case here. In general, it seems to be much closer to a DAO than a DO. However, there was one incident in 2013 where the reality proved to be rather different. What happened was that an exceptional block was (at least we hope) accidentally produced, which was treated as valid according to the BitcoinQt 0.8 clients, but invalid according to the rules of BitcoinQt 0.7. The blockchain forked, with some nodes following the blockchain after this exceptional block (we’ll call this chain B1), and the other nodes that saw that block as invalid working on a separate blockchain (which we’ll call B2). Most mining pools had upgraded to BitcoinQt 0.8, so they followed B1, but most users were still on 0.7 and so followed B2. The mining pool operators came together on IRC chat, and agreed to switch their pools to mining on B2, since that outcome would be simpler for users because it would not require them to upgrade, and after six hours the B2 chain overtook B1 as a result of this deliberate action, and B1 fell away. Thus, in this case, there was a deliberate 51% attack which was seen by the community as legitimate, making Bitcoin a DO rather than a DAO. In most cases, however, this does not happen, so the best way to classify Bitcoin would be as a DAO with an imperfection in its implementation of autonomy.

He even accurately describes the situation we have in our hands today with the ongoing DAO attack. l I urge you to read the whole post though, so as not to be taken out of context.

In short, the sender address is mutexed and a public function modified to throw if called by an already mutexed sender.  The mutex is deleted before return.  The bare wrapper cost 31939 gas.

Drawbacks are that an isMutexed function can't call another isMutexed function in the same contract. This shouldn't be that much of a problem with a secure interface design limiting the number of public functions.

2818,ethereum,It's An attack on the DAO *And* Ethereum,"Is the recent attack on the DAO really limited to the DAO, as some suggest, or is it genuinely also a significant attack on Ethereum itself? After all, if the community ‘bails out’ the DAO here (as some characterize it), doesn’t that set a bad precedent? Where is the line drawn? 

These are valid concerns, at least as a starting point, and they are being asked and debated all around. I’d like to offer some clarifying thoughts, however that support the ‘combined attack’ view.

First, consider that issue of trust. ‘Network Trust’ is perhaps the first topic that arises in the debate over how to respond to this attack. The argument goes, “We shouldn’t jeopardize network trust (various forking strategies) over this attack that was fundamentally on a single DAapp,” or “I’m not a DAO token-holder, so why should I care?”

The fatal flaw with these views even from an isolated, self-interested perspective, I believe, is that so-called ‘Network Trust’ comes in several inescapable flavors, depending on the objective. Furthermore, trust is also one of those things that is hard to earn, but easy to lose; hard to measure, yet we know it when we see it, and we know when it is lost.

The plain reality is, due to both the youth of Ethereum and the significance of the damage, this attack presents Ethereum with a defining problem: The pitting of *technological trust* against *economic trust*. To preserve one while losing the other is to lose period as miners would quickly experience, I believe. Miners losing then degrades the very technological strength those advocates fought so hard to maintain, if they are growth-minded at all. [Side note: I believe this was the attackers true objective, for s/he seems to have carefully planned how much ETH to drain initially to stoke this divide rather evenly].

So, is Ethereum seeking to become a niche crypto-development sandbox or a world-impacting alternative economy? If the former, let technology reign supreme at all costs. If that latter, the community does well to find and select an answer that minimizes the combined loss of trust (technological and economic), as this is the true measure of ‘Network risk.’ Maintaining one or the other alone is still failure for Ethereum in a meaningful way.

PS: Mega kudos to the community’s overall handling of this crisis so far in light of all of the above…optimizing for maximum recovery with minimum interference seems to be the goal. I am confident the whole community will resolve this problem effectively, without ‘civil war,’ thereby defeating the attacker decisively.",1466604762

Its obvious that a soft or hard fork to freeze, blacklist, or return funds (Eth or Tokens) isn't a viable option. However, it appears that the idea to simply destroy all assets associated with the DAO (Eth or Tokens) can fit within a sustainable crypto economic model, akin to bitcoin's 2-of-2 multisig escrow. 

Is this the ""middle ground"" to keep a bad actor from obtaining the ""stolen"" funds while maintaining the reputation of the network? I understand that it is still subject to miners/community, so it is not a sustainable option, but it seems, in principle, that it does align with traditional crypto trust/fairness theory.

Code using this tag would throw an exception ""Recursive Call Disallowed"" when a second call into the same method was attempted on the same EVM call stack.

For many methods / contracts, this would be preferred behavior.

2840,ethereum,Survey - At what point would you support a Soft or Hard Fork?,,1466614664
2841,ethereum,Proposal: Consensus of Finality,"So, currently, the ethereum system considers when the coin is sent to be the final say in the transaction; the contract executes and whatever the result is, no matter the result, is accepted as final. This is a problem because of the inevitable flaws that will be found in contracts. Rather than pushing soft requirements on contract developers and trusting that their code conforms to this, or even trusting that code review will have found a subtle bug, maybe there could be some cryptographic work that will assure that in fact the final result is indeed what was intended. I don't think it's worth it to require that all contracts be proven correct, to have a formally verified EVM, to have a language that supports all those features, and so on. That would be tremendously difficult and expensive. 

Rather, users of ethereum should rest their faith in a second confirmation point, at which time they can assess that the contract did indeed uphold their wishes. In this way, participants of a contract transaction would, up front and before the contract were ever started, agree upon a second contract, called the failure contract and some modes of complaint enactment. In this way, supposing that the EVM ever misbehaves or the network misbehaves, a quorum of the users could in fact enact the failure contract to perform some cancellation of transactions.

In the future, when developing any multi-party agreement, there should in fact be a number of different contracts in place. The DAO saved itself by having child DAO funds frozen, but in the case of another contract that executes with effects that are more immediate, this would have meant an irrevocable loss of funds. 

I propose that the fundamental ethereum design should include in all contracts a default consensus of finality in the process of all contract executions, in such a way that users can confirm *after* the transaction that in fact the code operated as expected. This confirmation has to be backed by another cryptographic blockchain operation requiring a password, in such a way that complaints cannot be forged or manipulated; they are identical but separated from the same ledger operations that represent balance.

You might say that this could result in some contracts becoming frustrated in the case that a customer becomes angry if they do not get what they want, but in which case they in fact do not deserve to, or should not. This case probably only ever matters if there is many parties interacting in a transaction, because if it were just two, then that is the way we already do transactions today. In the case of many parties, it may be that some quorum among those vested in some interest may be granted some power up front to agree when a contract has misbehaved. In the case of the new default, it is implicitly enforced as a vanilla contract provided by the ethereum foundation, or supplanted by  one of the author's choosing.

In the future, if this proposal makes it far, automatic consensus terms could be added on the part of customers to allow those vigilant against attackers to rest some, having some computerized checks to ascertain whether or not they are very highly likely to believe what operations are valid or invalid. 

This could be combined with an alert, and some custom EVM machinery to automatically simulate and debug a contract execution, this way response operations are already in place to cope with future attacks.

2845,ethereum,Let's discuss the core of what makes Eth 'Eth',"So after numerous discussions with individuals in the community, and reading on the start of Eth, I feel like the discussion of whether or not to fork is missing, or glossing over, a few core principles of Eth people don't seem to really care about.

I know what I am about to say will ruffle some feathers, and will frustrate some people, but please consider the first and most important fact that rises above all the rest.

You, fully in free will, invested your money into a risky, unproven system with little to no history on brand new untouched ground. And that's okay!

But, we need to remember what it is that makes Eth 'Eth', and I posit that ANY hard fork attempt in response to these attacks will forever and always cause a permanent change to not just what Eth is, but also completely warp the entire crux of what makes the Ethereum community what it is.

Ethereum is supposed to be decentralized, a no-man's land free free from control and litigation. A true, perfect free market economy with zero intervention.

And I think such a thing would be beautiful. And scary. And powerful! And intimidating. But also eloquent.

We designed an amazing game, a beautiful machine with simple yet complex rules. A game anyone can play from anywhere.

And someone beat us at the game because they discovered a loophole in the rules.

But one important fact remains as to how important this loophole is: If one designs a smart contract with knowledge of the loophole, can you prevent it from happening again?

If so, then all this means is from this point forward more effort needs to be put into designing better smart contracts without loopholes, and us as investors need to be wiser with how we use our money, and not just blindly trust what we hear and see.

Now, what I consider to be the most important principle is as follows, please read this:

If we choose to hard fork, we can never go back. Eth will be forever warped, changed, tainted. It will never be able to be a true free market, because we will set a precedent that when the community is presented with a challenger, instead of overcoming it or moving on, we will instead just lock up another gate and complicate things a little bit more.

Which means when a big company in the future designs a smart contract, they won't worry too much about flaws in the system, because 'we'll just hard fork if something goes wrong'

Why is this important?

One day hard forking won't be a solution, and we won't be able to just hand wave a problem away with a fork.

And when that day comes, if we just solved all our problems with hard forks, we won't be ready for it.

If you truly, deeply want a true free market, then you need to accept that hackers are not only an irremovable part of the system, but also necessary. Because an ecosystem needs predators to stay fit and healthy. Without the threat of a predator we become sated, fat, and weak.

I think defeating a predator and overcoming it is the only way for us to survive the long term game. Not changing the rules to make the predator disappear. If the community wants to be seen by future investors as a real system, a power player, we need to bare our teeth back.

And most importantly, thank the hacker for showing us our weakness. Because we will never improve or become stronger without someone there to point out our flaws that need improving.",1466617295

If we want smart contracts to have humans determine when they're not functioning as expected, we should create a system suited to that purpose.  We could create an arbitration body built into the ethereum code.  For example, maybe miners elect people to the arbitration board for terms of some period, and all parties to a smart contract have the option to access the board for a nominal fee (to prevent spam).

It's clouding your seeing forest through the trees. This tech is too new to be a purist or think code is law at this point. There is human error and intentions involved and this is first major contract (The Dao) to be tried. Lets not get overly idealistic about it at this point. 

First off nobody is going to care a year or two from now about hard fork outside of cryptos, and only very small minority of those with purist libertarian mindset are the loudest here against the fork. A hard fork is a must at this point, as attacker continues to show malicious and outright criminal intent. We have a solution, and should use it. 

Intent is not being spoken of much here, but his hacker is purposely stealing funds that are not his, through a backdoor loophole in code, and is trying to undermine and control more ETH than anyone owns.  This simply is not acceptable to any one that believes in honest way of doing things in life. It's against our value system in the West. 

Second the intent of this hacker anything but ill. He could have pointed out flaw, returned funds, and asked for very small and reasonable bounty for his hack, and most would have agreed to pay him something small for his finding a major bug. Instead he continues to steal while we have this insane discussion about crypto purism and idealistic nonsensical way things should work in cryptoland. It's in BETA.. Think about that for a second. Do we want SEC sniffing around or do we want to self correct this and set it on proper track. All this talk about lose of confidence is mostly FUD and will only be temporary if at all in coming year. 

Intent is everything, and having sole player owning that much ETH going into staking, he will control the network and will doom this project by his ill gotten control of supply of tokens that many here seem to think it okay for him to steal out of some strange delusional reality they live in that is absent in the real world where idealism doesn't work. 

Example I would like to point out is Battle of Waterloo and Rothschild theft of British stock market. If you don't know the story, I suggest you read up on it, but in short they lied (intent) about who won the battle and used methods to get their news first to cause a panic sell off in markets, knowing full well opposite was true and cornered the market for pennies. This was not done by fair trading, or speculation, research, or investing. It was Theft (intent) to take away from those other investors by phony information. If they had arrested Rothschild and tried him for fraud or insider trading, (intent to steal) history might have unfolded differently. 

Now, if you are aware of the outcome of this and the massive power this banking cartel has harmed the world in it's policies and control over the ages, then you can see this is not something we would like to have in Ethereum network, and can avoid this with a HARD FORK. 

Make no mistake about it, this is our battle of waterloo moment. Choose wisely or someone could be the crypto Rothschild with so much influence we are at the mercy of their direction they take this once POS kicks in. If we don't get this right, history will rhyme.

2868,ethereum,Idea to make hardforks easier (In case if they are unavoidable),"**EDIT 1: idea withdrawn. Sorry for the fuss!**

**EDIT 2:** what if we replaced DEV pgp key (from idea below) with some proof of stake pgp key. I mean not miners will decide about block version, but the collective of ethereum owners. After all they use ethereum, they want it to work in the best way for the user. While miners have a shorter horizon: in theory they only care about their own profit.

---------------
Since hardfork is unavoidable now, we could use this opportunity to add a very simple code that would make **wrong** miners to reject **their own blocks**. The mechanism is super simple:

* a block version is signed with a MINER_1 pgp key
* the MINER_1 pgp key is itself signed with DEV pgp key, thus the miner knows the key with which to sign its block, but cannot change it, since the miner does not know the DEV pgp key.
* if a miner detects on the network a block signed with a different MINER_2 pgp key, which itself is correctly signed with the DEV pgp key it then reads the block version signed with MINER_2 pgp key, and knows that this version is valid. Because the MINER_2 pgp key is also signed with DEV pgp key.
* the miner takes larger version from the two version numbers (the MINER_1 version number and MINER_2 version number) and from now on the miner starts rejecting all blocks with smaller version number, even if these blocks are its own blocks.
* the block version number could also be a blockchain height, to establish the exact point in the blockchain starting from which the blocks must be rejected
* the miner cannot change its own version number hardcoded in the source code, because that would require it to know the DEV pgp key.

I know. It puts more power to the DEVs, but it solves any kind of hardfork problems if they become necessary. Which happens very rarely. But **always** when it happens, the situation is critical, and must be performed very fast to minimize losses.

The DEV pgp key could also be protected with some multi-signature pgp kind, and some fallback mechanism if it got compromised. However this fallback mechanism will have to reviewed super-carefully, because it could introduce vulnerability by itself. A mathematical proof that there is no vulnerability in the fallback mechanism would be useful at this point. However this can be done a little later. After current problem is solved.",1466626015

https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4pb75e/this_is_what_good_community_leadership_looks_like/

and reading the latest: ""White Hat Siphoning has Occurred. What Now?""
https://blog.slock.it/white-hat-siphoning-has-occurred-what-now-f7ba2f8d20ef#.mglcr7m9y

I see that the collective mind got locked on 3 options:

1. Hard Fork. Liquidate. - ETH returned proportionally to DAO tokens held.
2. Soft Fork. Freeze. - 14% of ether becomes blocked indefinitely.
3. NO Fork. Do nothing. - most of 14% will likely go to attacker(s) and then perhaps on the market.

While Gavin in the video does mention some negotiation with the hacker he does not offer it as an option nor proposes anything related to it.

Since the main probable motives of the attacker are:
A. Financial. - He is after the money.
B. Hostile. - He is after damaging the Ethereum network.
C. Other.

It seems feasible to try in parallel to working on the forks to make an offer to the attacker that will be hard for him to refuse in case his motive is A (Financial). If he has other motive this will probably not work.

The idea posted by Adam Byrne on CoinDesk article is below:

""
&gt;Adam Byrne • 2 days ago
My solution to #TheDao impasse.

1. Create a new (and properly vetted, this time) smart contract which will release an agreed and appropriate sum to the hacker.

For the sake of argument, let’s say $1 million, which (it could be argued) is a just reward for his ingenuity and attention to detail.

2. Create another smart contract (or use the same one?) to release the rest of the funds back to an escrow account (assuming that the total investment was $160 million, then $159 million will be returned).

Therefore less than one percent (0.625 percent) has been ‘lost’ to the hacker.

3. These losses will be spread on a pro rata basis across all the investors in The Dao.

For example, if you put in $100, you get back $99.375.

4. Refund the investors through yet another (properly vetted) smart contract and then close down The Dao permanently.

Advantages:

Fund are unfrozen.

The hacker walks away with a reward but relinquishes all claims on the rest of the funds.

Everyone else walks aways with an almost full refund.

MOST IMPORTANTLY:

No roll back (fork) is necessary.

No disastrous precedent is set and the integrity of the Ethereum blockchain is preserved.

The efficacy of properly designed and vetted smart contracts is proved.

We can all move forward and learn from the mistakes that were made.

PS. I do realize that the hacker ‘made it away’ with ‘only’ $50 million of the total $160 million or so invested in The Dao but the precise numbers are not the most important aspect of my proposed solution. Someone else can do the exact calculations.
""

**If attackers interest is financial it makes a financial sense to get a guaranteed 1% of a big sum then get nothing with the implementation of a fork that will also cause damage to Ethereum.**

I ask for a **constructive** discussion on this thread to try to brainstorm a possible way to offer the attacker(s) a solution to deposit all of the funds into a refund contract with the option to automatically send 1% to the attacker(s) address. This is in order to avoid implementing any kind of fork and avoid damage to ethereum eco system.

This is more elegant and desirable solution if the attacker will be willing to cooperate and does not hold in his intention to hurt the ethereum community.

Voting isn't something you do once, and then you are done. It is a continuous indefinite process. The day that counts is the day when there is a transaction request from the hacker. The transaction will then be included in the blockchain only if a majority of the hash power accepts it.

The advantage of a hardfork is that it is switched to at a predefined block.

**How**

You vote with your mining hash power, depending on what node SW you are using. 

**Pools**

A pool is a little different as it usually shares the same SW. Some pools can have an option by supplying two different connections, and then use one or the other branch of the fork for your hashing. That way, they can leave it to the participants to decide.",1466664983

That seems completely reasonable to me; if you're investing in the success of a design project, like the SpaceX rocket, **whether you lose your money because the rocket spec isn't useful or you lose your money because the actual rocket wasn't designed according to spec and it crashes and burns**, you still lost fair and square.

You can blame gravity (the ""attacker"") if you want, but in the case of TheDAO they were just the person to do what someone else would eventually have done.

Basically meaning, white hats need to forever keep hounding the attacker down into more child DAOs. Doesn't seem like wanted outcome? I mean, it would keep ~11m ether out of circulation, but no one wants to have the job of being a DAO guardian, to eternally stalk the attacker?",1466680483

[15 Question Public Survey](https://www.murvey.com/s?576b87f922f26fe60190f413)

I wanted to see some polling on how the Ethereum community in general feels on a variety of issues related to the ""The DAO"", regulation on Ethereum, proposals on Forks and even Vitalik's approval rating. 

I also included a few questions to better understand the demographics of the Ethereum community. And to better compare this poll today to ones in the future. Obviously, this is a non-scientific poll. All answers except for Question 1 were randomized to not bias any specific answer.

I also tried very hard to make sure all the questions and answers were as neutral as possible.  I will also continue to do polling in the future with some of the same questions to measure values over time.  

The poll will be closed after tomorrow. This poll is not affiliated with any group or third party. It is conducted solely by me.  Please Vote and Share!

ETH: 0x695CF84D0feD4D6d0d9e8B892f5357D7cf274876

Edit 1: After 325 votes and almost 3 hours. The (%) of voters claiming to be miners is holding steady at around 20%-23%. Only 10 women have voted.  

Edit 2: After 526 votes. 12:17PM EST. The percentage of respondents from Europe is holding strong. Will they still have plurality by end? We find most users seem to be around the age group of 29-35 years of age, with those under 18 to be rarer than the women.  Miners continue to hold at around 22%~. 

Edit 3: 1:22 AM EST. Over 1,000 now! IMO sample of respondents looks ""healthy"" for a poll. ATM only 3.33% reported they only had BTC and (ironically) only 3.33% reported they had no crypto. I imagine these are people looking into crypto or ETH, are temporarily on the sidelines, interested in the development but not quite involved... etc... Also, age groups are diverse and will be interesting to compare to future polls. 

One thing that does seem clear is that Vitalik has a nice Approval Rating. 72%~ Approve compared to only 6%~ who Disapprove. Only 19%~ think he has too much influence on Ethereum.  Which could be perceived as healthy skepticism. 30% Not Sure/Don't Care. ",1466682094

2952,ethereum,What will happen at a soft fork,"Suppose the soft fork version of the node is used that rejects all transfers from theDAO.

1. At some point, someone will request a transfer of ether from a DAO or a child DAO. It can be the malicious hacker, or anyone that wants to force the fork to happen.

2. A miner not using the forked SW will include this in a block (unless 100% of the miners have switch to new SW). At this point, the blockchain will split into two incompatible chains.

3. One of the chains is going to have more hashpower than the other. This is where the real voting happens!

4. Exchanges will probably play it safe, and simply go for the longest chain as that is the chain with the most hash power, and thus also the lowest block time. That means they can simply wait and see what happens.

5. Miners finding they are mining on the shorter blockchain can no longer use their ether on exchanges, and will change to the longest chain. Thus, consensus will quickly be reached.

Whether the soft fork will win or not, I don't know, but there are some interesting things going on. E.g. EthereumJ already has SW that supports a soft work from block #1760000. At the time of this writing, that would be in approximately 3400 blocks, which would be 14 hours!

This can turn out to be interesting. Anyone that calls SplitDAO() after that block will force the fork to happen! At that point in time, I predict that only a minority of the miners actually supports the soft fork, and it will fail. All miners using EthereumJ with this change will at that point probably find they are on the shortest blockchain. In my opinion, it was a mistake to force the soft fork already at block #1760000. It is much too early.",1466683832
2953,ethereum,FORK: Call for Ethereum Governance Rules,"**I urge the Ethereum Foundation and the whole Ethereum community, to discuss and establish transparent Governance Rules, specifying under what circumstances  forks can/must/will happen.**

*DISCLAIMER: I don’t hold THE DAO tokens, and never did, having been extremely skeptical about its design and the potential attack vectors. I have been involved in the Ethereum community since 2014, and I am behind Diamond Coin, which is  based on the Ethereum platform.*

As soon as I was aware of the DAO exploit (a couple of minutes after it started), I cautioned all involved parties to keep the big pictures in mind, and not rush to hasty conclusion (roll backs or forks).

My biggest worries with Forks were (and still are):

* Moral Hazard. When careless investors buy into a crappy smart contract, they should face the consequence of their action and greed; otherwise incentives for writing proper contracts disappear. If a rushed deployment of a smart contract that leads to an exploit is “rewarded” by a fork, it creates a bias against developers who are prudent and risk being late to the market in favor of solid security. (I personally can relate to this, as we were struggling with the design-inherent features/problems of Solidity for a long time. Our approach was to continue working on the smart contracts instead of rushing to the market with a solution that transfers the risk to the investors).
* Attack vectors from law enforcement, tax authorities etc. If forking is possible like this, expect authorities to step in and pressure relevant decision makers. This is completely at the detriment of Ethereum ‘s promise to be immutable and impartial.
* Alignment of incentives. The foundation and several of its members are rumored to be heavily invested in the DAO. There is a clear (though possibly unfounded) perception of a conflict of personal and public interest if developers associated with the foundation work to bail out The DAO. Worse, this may lead to personal liability for the developers, as Drew Hinkes argues in this [post](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/a-legal-analysis-of-the-dao-exploit-and-possible-investor-rights-1466524659?utm_content=buffera3532&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer).


Given the dimension of the exploit (up to ~14% of the current ETH supply could be potentially blocked ad quasi-infinitum), it is certainly fair to explore all options, though. This includes forks. So what are the solutions?
* I still have a certain sympathy for advocates of the “move on, take the cut” solution, as a 14% cut of ETH might not be live-threatening for the eco-system of Ethereum
* Personally, I believe an efficient counter attack would by far be the most desirable option how to deal with the situation. Unfortunately, this option does not seem likely at the moment (hope never dies ;)   )
* A hard fork is the next option. It comes with a software update. This is at least a transparent solution for each user, who can opt in.
* Finally, there are soft forks. Soft forks are not only cumbersome, highly complicated and unsecure in their outcomes; they also rely on miners who can be bribed, threatened, influenced. Furthermore, an “official” incentive for miners to collude is the totally wrong thing in my opinion.

From the four options given above, the hard fork seems to be the most realistic. So let’s have a closer look at how to pave the way for a hard fork without damaging the trust in the stability and credibility of Ethereum forever.

a)	Hard forks are a common thing when upgrading the functionality of a Blockchain. Per se, there is nothing negative with a hard fork, thus. This needs to be communicated in a broad way.

b)	As I argued above, there are a lot of issues with a hard fork to bail out a DAPP that was exploited, and they need to be addressed.

c)	The worst outcome from allowing a hard fork at this time is the subsequent insecurity when the same thing can happen again.

d)	It can be mitigated when clear and transparent rules are applied to judge if a hard fork is adequate.

e)	This rule set should be discussed publicly and in a decentralized way. Like this, developers and members of the foundation are protected, as there is a social consensus that drives the action, not unilateral decisions 

f)	The Ethereum Foundation has an important role to play as a moderator of the discussion, and by formulating the outcome

**THUS, I urge the Ethereum Foundation and the whole Ethereum community, to discuss and establish transparent Governance Rules, specifying under what circumstances  forks can/must/will happen.**

We have roughly 20 days to come to a conclusion, and apply it to the DAO case. It will be crucial to re-establish the trust in Ethereum. 
Finally, A BIG UP to all of you who are tirelessly work to discover security weaknesses, and to fix them. Let’s emerge stronger from this crisis.

Are you?,"Like a lot of people I guess, I have been looking for ways of fixing this without a hard fork, but so far nobody found one that do so that does not at least requires targeted/coordinated soft forks.  
  
And with all the various opinions about forking out there, I don't think this is  happening.  It's disheartening to see posts downvoted when they are only looking for solutions and laying down options.  
   
At this point the community is deeply divided and I am losing hope in us, as a whole agreeing on a solution.  
Some are OK with soft forks but see hard fork as a danger.  
Other see any fork as pure evil.  
Some want the DAO token holder to be punished.  
Then there is the disagreement over what happened being a robbery.
  
I think the are three main groups here:  
1- Ethereum technology promises over anything else  
2- Ethereum social promises over anything else  
3- ""Whatever gives me more money""  
  
At this point, I'm starting to doubt group 1 and 2 can cohabit in the same crypto.  
The disagreement over what Ehtereum is runs too deep into morale and visions of life/society.  
  
My suggestion is we shake hands, part ways and go develop the crypto that matches our vision.  
Most probably, one will thrive, the other will die.  
But at least we will all have invested in something we truly believed in.  
  
Let's hard fork.  
If not to save TheDAO, then to save what each of us believes Ethereum should be.  
That's a reason worth taking a loss for.

2979,ethereum,The Least Bad Option,"As a DAO token holder, when I first heard that the DAO had been hacked I thought all the money was permanently gone. That was a bad feeling I felt not just for myself, but for the entire Ethereum community and the hope and promise of The DAO.

When I heard there was a time lock, and soft and hard fork options to fix the problem, the pendulum swung the other way and I once again became overly confident in the tech, and falsely concluded there would be a painless 'fix.' However, thanks to the good work of Emin Gun Sirer, I realized just how many unexplored issues there actually were – technical, legal, social, governanace related, etc. I have posted his thoughts from his NY Meetup PPT below, and would encourage everyone to take a quick look them.

We were talking about this in our Portland Ethereum meetup, and let's face it, mistakes were made by Slock.it, AND Solidity was not tested enough and ready for roll out, and we all made a mistake rushing ahead. We are all responsible for this mess. We all need to realize there are no good options here.  But, if we can work together to find a distributed solution where we all share some of the pain, and come to an agreement collectively, that would be the least bad option.

I first was attracted to the soft fork, but the more I learned about it, I realized it was temporary, would take extraordinary measures and cooperation from miners, which is not their original agreement and not what they signed up to do, and then it would only lock up the tokens, not recover them.  Then the hacker joined the white hat draining of the DAO, which suddenly seemed like an endless loop, until we would further have to select white hats who would be allowed to transfer the tokens but nobody else would. It seemed to be a rabbit hole that became more temporary, and more convoluted, requiring an increasing number of actions that violated our core principles the further we pursued it. All of this is bad for the Ethereum Foundation and the future of the Ethereum. The idea of the soft fork quickly appeared a good temporary but bad intermediate and horrible long run option.

I then felt that a hard fork was the only solution, but honestly that was strongly influenced by the idea that a hacker stealing $50m is bad short run, and it's bad long run, so the worst option.

I have been involved with Ethereum for about a year, and must admit I did not come from the Bitcoin community, but from the currency mechanics and payments community, and was originally intrigued only by what might be possible using smart contracts, so that’s what I want to protect, and the real long run value for me. When I spoke with my technical friends who had come from the Bitcoin community, they really, really did not like the hard fork, and felt it would be better to let the hacker walk. I listened to them carefully, and changed my mind. 

I also realized that for most people in our community, either hard forking or letting the hacker walk was the worst option, with the other being the second worst option, and soft fork being the third worst option.

From game theory and life, I have learned the longer this goes on, and the closer it gets to the time lock expiring, the higher probability for additional unexpected bad outcomes, unforeseen forks in the road, which I am sure the hacker is working furiously on. The quicker this is resolved, the better for everyone, maybe even the hacker. The soft fork should not lull us into complacency, but be a temporary measure of days and weeks, not longer.

Ultimately, I realized the least bad option is to setup a binary outcome, where we agree to either pay a bounty to the hacker by a specific date, or if he is unreasonable, then go ahead and implement a hard fork. If it doesn't work, at least we tried, and I think the effort will count for something in the long run. 

As long as this decision happens before the time lock expires, the hacker knows a hard fork has been agreed to and is definitely coming, and the decision date is firm, the hacker's best outcome is to accept the bounty in exchange for releasing the rest of the ETH. Maybe the hacker would prefer to force the community into a hard fork due to antisocial or anti-Ethereum motives, but money is a powerful motivator. I know, people will not like negotiating or appeasing a hacker, but if we take responsibility collectively for this problem, our problem, that we all created, then this is the least bad solution, for the following reasons:

1. It avoids the worst (or second worst) option of a hard fork.
2. It avoids the second worst (or worst) option of the hacker walking away with $50m ETH.
3. It makes everyone pay a price, so avoids in some measure the moral dilemma problem.
4. It's the only negotiated solution, which can’t be understated how valuable and important that could be for our leaderless community.
5. It protects the Ethereum foundation and the miners from having to violate core principles to save slock.it's bad coding, or from being tempted to collude with the hacker.
6. Paying for bounties is part of the software ecosystem, and although the number is big in real terms, it's still just a number.
7. It solves the problem quickly, and as cleanly as possible. Again, there are no good options. 

The key to negotiating is not focusing on what the hacker gets, which in this case will just make you frustrated and angry, but rather focus on what the community gets, the least bad option that maybe prevents the community from splitting into two camps. That alone is maybe the most important thing to me personally, and to others I know. Ethereum is still young, and as a community we have important challenges ahead; let’s put this behind us with minimal damage ASAP. That’s what taking responsibility collectively in practice really means. 

If you agree, then we simply need to set a price. I think I read someone else had proposed 5%, which is a relatively painless learning lesson for each of us individually, but a sizable and potentially life changing bounty for the hacker(s). Remember, it won't work unless the incentive to play nice is substantial.

We have all had time to think about this and mull over the options, but now we need to find the will to come together and create a solution, the least bad solution. I say pay the bounty in exchange for returning the DAO tokens, kill the DAO 1.0, and be done with it. 

What say you?

DAO Unknowns
Is it actually possible to build secure, functional smart-contracts?
•	What about the fine print you see on regular contracts?
•	What’s in the fine print?
•	How to form the contract covenant The spirit of the agreement How to resolve disputes
•	How to modify the contract
•	How to terminate
The DAO, as we will see, messed up almost all of these

Enter The DAO
•	Usurped the phrase “The DAO” for a specific investment fund
•	Part kickstarter, part Andreesen-Horowitz
    o	Built by Slock.It, a company originally intended to kickstart an IoT bike lock, but built a kickstarter instead
•	How it is supposed to work o We all buy into The DAO with ether
    o	The DAO amasses a fund
    o	Contractors come before The DAO with proposals
    o	We all vote on the proposals
    o	If we achieve a quorum, and there is support, proposals get funded
    o	Proposals then return rewards, distributed back out

The DAO Complications
•	Buying in
•	Voting
•	Exiting
•	Modifying the Contract
•	Payouts

The DAO Buy-In
•	27-day creation phase
•	Buy in with ether
    o	1.00 ether for 100 DAO Tokens for 14 days o +0.05 ether every day for 10 days
    o	1.50 ether for the last 3 days
•	Additional gains accumulate in “extraBalance”
•	Why is there a rising scale?
•	Do “viral features” have any place in sound investments?

The DAO Proposals
•	Anyone can submit a proposal
•	Curators pick proposals
    o	Requires a 5 out of 11 signature
    o	11 members of the Ethereum community, unrelated to SlockIt
•	The curators’ job description is unclear o Is it to just check identity?
    o	Is it to “protect the DAO”?
    o	The curators are not paid, but they are under substantial legal risk
The Voting
•	Any DAO token holder can vote on a proposal
•	A proposal is funded if
    o	There is a quorum (sufficient votes)
    o	The majority of the quorum is in favor (voted YES)
•	Required quorum sizes vary by size of contract
    o	Largest required quorum is 53%
•	Votes are weighted by a voter’s holdings
•	But a voter commits The DAO funds (i.e other people’s money) to proposals
•	Someone who voted cannot exit The DAO

The Exit
•	Cannot just take money out of The DAO
    o	Why? Because of viral/social reasons
•	To exit, you need to follow a 62-step process:
    o	Initiate a proposal to make yourself a curator
    o	Anyone can vote YES or NO on this proposal
    o	It will likely fail
    o	You can call splitDAO on a failed proposal
    o	A new child-DAO will be created where you are the curator
    o	You can now propose to withdraw funds, approve it as curator, vote on it, and then take the ether back out • Takes 27+7 days
•	Takes 27 + 7 days

Upgrades and Rewards
•	There is no provision to modify The DAO in place o 
    o	No kill switch
    o	No security upgrades
    o	Cannot preserve the full state and change code
•	The extraBalances can only be spent after The DAO has spent an equivalent amount on proposals
•	Unclear about the intended behavior with regard to
•	rewards
    o	Inherited into childDAO’s, but not into grandchildren

The DAO Token Markets
•	DAO tokens can be bought and sold on open markets
•	Their price will reflect the expected value of future ether flows
•	Until The DAO funds a proposal, 1 token = 0.01 eth
•	But in USD terms, the price will fluctuate
•	The price difference will reflect the uncertainty in the
•	value of 1 eth, 34 days from now o 
    o	E.g. 1 eth = $15
    o	But 1 dao = $13
•	This is a normal consequence of decisions in DAO design

Taking Stock
•	Why was The DAO designed the way it was?
    o	To avoid legal meddling?
    o	To help fund illegal operations? o To create Ponzis?
    o	“Sunny-day thinking”
•	Aspirational system design
•	Does The DAO idea even make sense?

The Questions
•	Are the crowds even able to pick winning strategies?
    o	Do fund managers really bring 0 value to the world?
•	Will we ever reach the quorums required?
    o	Most token holders are passive
    o	The risks of “going with the crowd” without voting
•	Are the mechanisms in The DAO suited for the tasks that need to be carried out?

The Questions

    o	Most token holders are passive
    o	The risks of “going with the crowd” without voting
•	Are the mechanisms in The DAO suited for the tasks that need to be carried out?
NO!

The Call for a Moratorium
•	My colleagues and I were alarmed that The DAO managed to collect 11M eth, $220M USD
•	The internal mechanisms were broken
•	We rushed a manuscript that detailed the failures, called for a moratorium
•	The DAO community was convinced and wanted to upgrade The DAO

The Hack
•	While we were in a holding pattern, someone emptied out a substantial fraction of The DAO
•	The hacker took $50+M worth of ether into a child-DAO called the Dark-DAO
•	Hacker took advantage of multiple attack vectors
    o	A reentrancy bug in the DAO code
    o	Additional tricks to avoid getting his balance reset
    o	He also voted YES on every other split proposal, to reserve the right to pursue everyone who wanted to split
•	Hide your kids, hide your pets, there is no safe place

The Hack Technicalities
	
 
What If The DAO Had Not Been Hacked
•	It still would have been hacked
•	It was and is deeply broken
•	The design of voting mechanisms that capture the will of the crowds is a difficult nuanced task
•	Everybody on the Internet is an expert at three things:
    o	Economics
    o	Game theory
    o	Distributed Systems
•	The DAO team, and others like it, full of hubris and the Dunning-Kruger effect, are easy targets

Guiding Principle
•	DAO-1.0 is irredeemably broken, but let’s examine how one might build DAO-2.0 in light of what we have learned
•	The DAO voting mechanisms have to be truthful and strategy-proof
    o	Truthful: token holders vote their true opinion
    o	Strategy-proof: token holders fare best by voting their true opinion
•	The current mechanisms are broken in multiple ways

Affirmative Bias
•	Every voter has a unique valuation for every proposal o 
    o	“Prop #37 will bring in 3% yearly over 3 years”
    o	“Prop #37 will be a net loss, that team can’t pull it off”
    o	“Prop #37 will take us to the moon!”
•	Ideally, you want everyone to vote their conscience
    o	Positive Expected Value: +EV
    o	Negative Expected Value: -EV
•	+EV folks are incentivized to vote early
•	Not so for -EV!!!
    o	Negative votes lock people in
•	Early votes will be positive, feedback loops work against -EV folks

Stalking
•	A stalker can vote YES on a split proposal and follow a splitter into the child-DAO
•	Stalker is not going to be the curator, but he can be the dominant (53%) shareholder in the child
•	Stalker can keep the splitter from taking out his funds
•	Stalker can then blackmail the splitter
•	If the splitter splits again, he loses his rewards from the original DAO
•	SlockIt claimed that the splitter could counterattack, but do you want to play corewars?

Ambush
•	A -EV voter has a disincentive to vote, especially if his vote is not needed
•	So a big bloc of YES votes can come in at the last possible minute to pass a proposal that initially looked unpassable
•	This commits other people’s funds to a proposal, even though large fraction is against that proposal
•	Possible remedy: add time to the clock when the vote outcome changes

Token Raid
•	An attacker can move the price of DAO tokens by
    o	Incentivize people not to split but to sell their tokens
    o	Keep the public from snapping up tokens
•	She can do this by
    o	Creating social media panic, via stalker attack
    o	Passing a -EV proposal, via ambush attack
•	The price of tokens will drop, she can short on the way down, and snap up when the attack is over
•	This is a legitimate manipulation strategy, often seen with penny stocks, except the mechanisms make it easy

extraBalance Raid
•	Attacker forces people to split from The DAO, which leaves behind the extraBalance amount
•	Currently at 275,000 ether
•	DAO tokens should trade at 1.02
•	If the attacker scares away 95% of investors, DAO will trade at 2.00

Majority Takeover
•	SlockIt identified and worried about a majority takeover
•	A voting bloc of 53+% can fund 100% to a 1 proposal
•	Curators are expected to guard against this
    o	This scenario is specifically cited
•	But a voting bloc of 53+% can fund 10 proposals of 10%
•	No principled way to even define the attack, let alone defend against it
    o	DAO defenseless against Soros-style attacks

Reward Dilution
•	The DAO issues reward tokens as proposals pay back into the DAO
•	Akin to dividends
•	But the reward token math does not follow any accounting principle
•	In particular, reward tokens can be diluted even after someone has split off from the DAO

Risk-Free Voting
•	One of the many “race conditions”
•	Investor votes YES on a proposal, committing funds
•	Then invokes “unblockMe” before the proposal is executed, and splits off
•	This allows her to commit the DAO to a proposal without committing her own funds
•	An attack amplification vector

Concurrent Proposal Trap
•	Voting on any proposal commits the voter until the end of the voting period
•	Attacker poses a proposal
    o	We have seen “do you believe in God?” for 0 ether
•	Everyone who votes is banned from splitting until the end of the voting period
•	Attack amplification vector: push an incendiary proposal with a long voting period, then launch short-fuse attack

Independence Assumption
•	All of the discussion until now assumes that all proposals are independent
•	Yet in real life, proposals are linked
    o	Funding a cluster of proposals might yield much higher returns than funding them individually
•	Not an attack, but undesirable
•	This can yield strategic behavior (i.e. people voting down worthy proposals) even when everyone means well

What Have We Learned
•	The DAO is a fantastic experiment
•	The experiment has been a huge success
•	Enormous demand for smart contracts
•	The Ethereum core has some (well-contained) issues that need to be fixed
    o	The design of a secure smart-contract language is very different from the design of a web-programming language
•	The DAO is a hot mess

Methodological Issues
•	Why was The DAO designed the way it was?
    o	To avoid legal meddling?
    o	To help fund illegal operations?
    o	To create Ponzis?
•	Carefully thought-out viral features
•	Common behaviors were purposefully made difficult
•	“Sunny-day thinking,” aspirational ideas about best case behaviors
•	Irresponsible design, no safety mechanisms
•	Flawed methodology

Takeaways
•	Can we build a $1.2B ecosystem, while spending $0 on basic research and science of smart contracts?
•	How do we build and vet trustworthy smart contracts?

Remember that this was all about Bitcoin's coming halving.

So there's probably a bit more downside to take advantage of in the next month or so.

Don't try and pick the bottom though. Buy small parcels on the way down, and through any upward blips until a solid base is established. And be ready for the next surge... it will surely come. :)

2990,ethereum,Questionnaire: what Kinds of Transaction Reversals are acceptable to you?,"Suppose a smart contract has an error resulting in major loss of user funds. In which of the following cases would you support an intervention into Ethereum's normal operation to reverse the loss (via hard/soft fork, blacklist, etc.)? 

1. The smart contract was exploited by a human (as with TheDAO).

2. The smart contract was exploited by an autonomous agent.

3. The smart contract accidentally sent funds to an unspendable address or a random person.

4. The smart contract was exploited and the lost funds have subsequently been spent again, perhaps a number of times.

5. The smart contract spec is in another language than English/Chinese, making it hard to tell whether the behavior is intentional, and perhaps difficult for the affected parties to petition the community for redress.

6. The smart contract was written by an autonomous agent, and perhaps ""exploited"" by another autonomous agent but there is no way to know whether the behavior was intended (and therefore whether the action constituted an exploit) because the autonomous agent issued no human-language specification as to what the contract was supposed to do.

7. Joe Coder writes a smart contract that is *intended* to be a SatoshiDice style gambling dapp, but it is written poorly: instead of being truly random, its results are determined based on the digits of pi in sequential order. After the dapp has grown large, someone figures this out and exploits the dapp to the tune of many millions of ETH. ",1466700958

2994,ethereum,Public Bug Bounty Pledge from a Dao Token Holder,"TLDR- I am pledging 30% of any Ether returned to me from theDAO to bug bounties and/or other security improvements.

I am an Ethereum crowdsaler and theDAO token holder. I gave money to theDAO with the aim or using Ether to build out the Ethereum ecosystem. I was concerned about its structure and size but was excited to participate in a system where we used our own tools, our own wealth, and our own decisions to build our own ecosystem free from the potentially damaging influence of too much outside capital. I was excited by the profit potential to some extent but more excited by the still impressive concept of an investment fund denominated in the cryptocurrency of the platform it intends to build. To me a fund which could raise its own value significantly without even ever getting a direct return on investment is an incredibly powerful idea whose time will come. I was excited by the varied types of projects and ideas that were immediately put forth by developers all over when they witnessed just how much money was around wanting to be put into building out this ecosystem. I put in an amount I was okay with losing and if I never get it back that is a situation I had already prepared myself for.

At this point I don't have to tell you that too much money, not enough time, and too few safeguards were put into theDAO. We are in the midst of the first big crisis since Ethereum's launch which has touched off debates on code, law, security, morality, philosophy, and more. In the end I hope it makes our community stronger and the fact that is has happened this early on may be a great thing we will someday look back on as necessary and vital.

This post is not to advocate for any position on what to do. This post is simply to publicly voice my pledge I will use 30% of any Ether returned to me for improving the security of Ethereum as a whole. My current plan is to put it towards bug bounties but if anyone has a better idea for use of the funds I am open to it. Whether the money is returned to me through forking of any kind, white hat attacks or otherwise does not matter to the outcome of this pledge. All of the money I get back will be used to build Ethereum projects in one way or another, but 30% will go specifically to security concerns. I encourage other DTHs to pledge as well if they're interested. I'm not pressuring anyone, this is purely intended to be a voluntary thing and a demonstration of good faith and good will to the people who are working so hard to get our funds back in one way or another. Many people put in far, far more Ether than me and may not be able to afford such a pledge and I wouldn't judge them for that in the least. Please no one pressure anyone else into doing so and make no judgments about pledge amounts. I chose 30% simply as symbolic due to the rough estimation of the amount stolen.

The platform we're building is exciting but the developers and community behind it are just as exciting to me. We are building out a trustless infrastructure but ironically we have formed a community that deserves a great deal of trust and good will. This is my attempt to do a small part in preventing things like this from happening to those in the future. Thank you for everyone's hard work and dedication during this. ",1466702021

2998,ethereum,Venting my thoughts on the DAO So I Don't Explode :),"I keep hearing people say they are against helping the DAO investors get their funds returned. I can't take it anymore I am usually not a talker, but this time I need to state how I feel.  To these people I say...

Are you guys serious? You are saying you read the entire terms and conditions of all products and websites down to the fine print before accepting them?  If Apple for example placed in their newest TOS update (you know the 10 pages of fine print they update weekly) -by mistake and admitted it was an unintended mistake- on page 8 paragraph 3 you would be subject to a fee of 35-100% of your entire account value (siphoned from your account for nothing in return to an an anonymous entity) does that make it acceptable? Better yet, lets assume it was written in Spanish.  A language you sort of understand but not 100%.  That is how this code was to most people.  

I can understand you saying ""well if I couldn't understand it I wouldn't sign it"" but that is a LIE!  You know damn well that you accept things all the time that you don't fully read or understand.  

In those cases when the shit hits the fan you expect whatever legal system to be of reason and to side with you since you were taken advantage of (if it was something not fair looking in from the outside objectively). Sorry that I tried to support Ethereum development without fully understanding the entire TOS that I was under the impression Vitalik, Vlad, and many other major devs put their reputation behind! I'm so mad. Not only at this event but at the responses from my so called community of peers. I hope this is just Reddit trolls talking because if this type of mindset is over 33% of the actual community I am done plain and simple. 

I'll be gone and find a group of people who aren't jackasses to work with in the future. OK, I probably won't actually leave because I still love 95% of the devs and a lot of the community here, but I will be very unhappy and I also think that the mainstream will think we are an untrustworthy joke.  If we fix this they will think we are awesome and trust our platform. Am I totally wrong here?   In my example I would probably just sue Apple or something? I have no idea, my point is this is fixable! Can we just agree to do the reasonable thing and fix it, learn from it, and move on?",1466703763

Without forks to get back those money, 15% of all ether will either be burned or taken by The Attacker, leading to disastrous consequences, permanent exodus of those hard-core Ethereum backers (DAO investors) and loss of reinvestment into the ecosystem at this critical juncture.

If we are able to take back those money, most of them are still likely be reinvested into the Ethereum ecosystem, adding billions of dollar marketcap and further advance our course. 

Miners, Community Members, let's put the ideology aside and look at the bigger picture and how much we will be able to accomplish with those returned fund.

So imagine the miner solves a puzzle that shows in order to obtain the reward; 5 other adreses need to transfer a wei / token to a new adres. Once this is complete all the 6 adreses receive a part of the reward.

So you could do a sale of x amount puzzle pieces; or produce them on the chain with each transaction; ...or something. But the main idea would be that you need a few other adreses outside of your control. Maybe this idea could be used to promote running a full node (for keeping parts of the puzzle pieces).

So a larger part of the community would share in the profits of mining / hosting; and even if you buy a lot of ETH you still could not get a majority.

Please feel free to correct / modify / post new ones, I'll try to collect the essence in updates to this post!

**Safe send pattern**

Maybe this is the most urgently needed pattern. Basically you have to address these issues:  
1. Prohibit reentrancy  
2. Avoid gas issues  
3. Keep clean state records in case send fails.  

So this would be a proposal for a safe send pattern: http://pastebin.com/Lph5rdK4 (still without solution for the gas issue)

**Bookkeeping state invariants**

A contract should implement a proper, internal bookkeeping of the most important state variables which is verifiable by the contract itself: http://pastebin.com/HpGfw07S

**Naming Conventions**  
Event names should be preceeded by some Prefix like ""LOG_"".  

    event LOG_Transfer(uint amount, address from, address to);

**Verbose Wallets**  
The standard multisig wallet is extremly hard to track. Look at the curator wallet. It took some people much time to reengineer the function calls.  This is due to the fact that arbitrary code can be executed; the wallet only storing a hash of the to-be-called code. So if you want to know what code is called, you have to find the first transaction creating the hash and then dissassemble it. Very cumbersome.  
The wallet should contain links to verifiable function source code for the called code.
Therefore a standard multisig wallet should be restricted to calling some predefined functions only and it should be very verbose on which actions the owner are performing.  
Sample Code: still looking for; original code is here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum/dapp-bin/master/wallet/wallet.sol

- DAO curators/creaters get sued (but not so bad for EVM itself I guess)

3064,ethereum,"the ""No Seppuku Rule"" for when to fork","**Introduction**
There are many reasons why people feel passionately about forking or not forking, but I think the loss (or preservation) of immutability is very high on many people’s list of concerns. I’ve tried to read all the comments from the past 6 days, including the heavily down-voted ones, and I think the issue of immutability is the common ground that everyone (roughly) agrees is important. So let me try to assess the general sentiment in this sub. I may be wrong, but its worth giving this a shot anyways.

My (current) assessment is that the present divide in the community stems (roughly) from people not agreeing on how strict we should be about preserving immutability in precisely 100% of contracts. And if it is not preserved in precisely 100% of contracts, then by what general rule (or heuristic) do we agree immutability can be lost (if it is to be lost at all)?

**The Unstoppable Application Paradox**
Let us now attempt to derive such a rule. We’ll begin with a paradox, because paradoxes tend to be good intuition pumps for making progress on tough problems.

The paradox can be stated as, “Let C be an unstoppable application that results in some state Z such that Z is a state-of-the-world that stops C. If C is not stoppable, then its definition dictates that Z does not exist, and if Z does not exist, then it contradicts the definition of C as an application that results in state Z.”

Let’s call this contradiction the “Unstoppable Application Paradox”. This is clearly an antinomy, meaning it is an impossible paradox. So let us now use it as a basis for a new theorem:

**Unstoppability Theorem:** *Let C be an application that results in some state Z such that Z is a state-of-the-world that stops C. If Z exists, then C is not an unstoppable application.*

**Proof:** *Assume C is an unstoppable application. So by definition, C cannot be stopped. But if some state-of-the-world Z exists such that Z alters C, then C is stopped. But C is an unstoppable application, by definition, so if Z exists, we have contradiction. Therefore Z cannot exist if C is unstoppable. QED*

**The “No Seppuku Rule""**
So far this is all pretty obvious stuff. How does this help with the fork debate? Well, it forces us to face the real possibility that there might exist an application that the Ethereum network cannot render unstoppable (because the Ethereum network cannot protect itself from certain states-of-the-world that jeopardize its own security, which leads to the application being stopped). If we can accept this much, then we can derive a general rule for when to *defensively* fork the network.

**The “No Seppuku Rule"":** *If a contract is immutable, then it must never result in a state-of-the-world that jeopardizes the security of its own network. Should a contract lead to such a state, then it could not be immutable and so we are not beholden to treat it as such.*

Informally, the “No Seppuku Rule” simply says that we are not obligated to honour a contract that would harm the security of the network, since inaction would eventually lead to that contract being altered once the cost of attacking the network became trivial (due to the network having been mostly abandoned).

What does this rule mean? Seppuku is the term for ritual suicide. The idea here is that if there exists a contract that is so terrible it would lead to the demise of Ethereum, then Ethereum is not obligated to honour that contract, since that contract would eventually lead to its own demise by way of the demise of Ethereum. We thus do not betray our principles by altering such a contract, because it does not qualify as an immutable contract.

I’ll try to rephrase this again, just so it can be better understood.

If there exists an application that leads to the demise of Ethereum, then that application was not unstoppable, since it eventually stops itself. The network may thus reach consensus to stop such an application (if it exists), since said application would eventually be stopped by the demise of the network. Importantly, such an act does not betray our principles, since such an application cannot qualify as an unstoppable application (strictly speaking, it is of the wrong *type*).

**Conclusion**
To summarize, a contract that threatens the security of Ethereum cannot ever be an immutable contract, and so it does not qualify as the kind (or type) of contract that Ethereum is built for. We are thus not obligated to treat it as we would other contracts. Meanwhile, we are still obliged to treat all other contracts as-if they are effectively immutable, conditional on the continued security of the network.

The question we should then discuss is, would theDAO contract (with its easy-to-exploit vulnerability) result in a state-of-the-world that threatens the security of the network to such an extent that immutability is lost irrespective of whether we fork or not? If a case can be made that theDAO is such a contract, then it was never an immutable contract, and therefore we do not betray our principles by altering it.

It is now quite easy to argue for a fork, because theDAO contract (as it was written and then deployed), would have allowed explicitly malicious attackers to take possession of up to 15% of the ETH supply (potentially more if the sale had been even more ""successful""). This would then have led to risks to Ethereum's security, including the cost-free ability (to the thief) to readily and repeatedly crash the price of ETH such that it becomes (repeatedly) unprofitable for some miners to secure the network. Clearly this opens Ethereum up to a variety of repeated and sustained attacks, any of which could cause chaos, losses and and a mass exodus of users and capital from the network at a point in Ethereum's life where such attacks would be very difficult to recover from. There is also the risk of [wallet poisoning](http://forums.prohashing.com/viewtopic.php?t=871), and of course the risk that that much ETH in a the control of a malicious attacker would pose after the transition to PoS.

Now, it follows that if we accept that theDAO (as it was written and deployed) posed a very serious risk to the network, then the one risk that we do not need to worry about (per the No Seppuku Rule) is the risk of moral hazard from forking to alter this toxic contract. And this reasoning follows due essentially from the Unstoppability Theorem, which tells us that the theDAO was not, and could not, be an immutable contract because it leads to its own (eventual) demise, and thus it strictly cannot qualify as an unstoppable application.

TL;DR: With this post I hope to have merely offered a way to dissolve the ""moral hazard"" of forking on security grounds. 

**Postscript**
There are of course many other reasons to fork with a clear conscience, especially on pragmatic grounds, but only the security angle was explored in this post. Also keep in mind that I may have made an error in my reasoning. It is late, and it's been a long week.",1466744075

3088,ethereum,"A hardfork is not needed, Softfork can fix all","I see a lot of people advocating a hardfork as the only way to really fix the dao problem.

But the whole situation can be fixed by softfork because the attacker(s) is/(are) not curator in any of the child-DAOs.

So if the softfork censors all transactions that modify the balance of the DAOs except transactions made by the curator then all the money can already be returned to the original owners. It will just take time. But the fact that it takes time is actually a good thing for the majority of Ethereum holders because it locks up 14 percent of the Ethereum supply (for a while).

If we suddenly release all those Ethers back on the market it will induce a supply shock.

All the discussion about a hardfork quickly re-establishing confidence is non-sense. If we know the softfork is guaranteed to return all the funds in due time (Less then 2-3 months) then all the dao investor should simply wait and we should consider this discussion closed.

When the Ether was still in the DAO before the hack it was also locked up for a long time, so the current situation + softfork is the same situation for the DAO holders and also for the Ether holders. 

All a Hardfork will do is upset the hardliners and give the dao holders access to their investment a bit sooner.

I see the dao has been hacked but to a child dao so the coins are unspendable for some time, the rest got drained to a white hat dao using the same ""vulnerability"" right?

There are talks about forks, and as a miner i'd like to be shure what i'm voting for.

From what i understand, there is one option that Will revert transactions to keep the stolen ethers in the dao (Will it revert every transaction since?) And another one that Will make the stolen coins unspendable.

How exactly does this work, witch is witch, and Will the ether lost go back to the rightful owners? (If so how)

3109,ethereum,Proposal: Voting by long term commitment of Stake,"Although there is a lot of disagreement on the community about the Hard Fork solution, I believe we should all be able to find common ground. The solution should depend on objective answers to this question:

* Which solution will better to instill a larger confidence on the project?

* Who should have the power to make this decision (miners, developers, ether holders, app developers) and how can we make sure that group doesn't abuse this power in the future?

* There will be more crisis, hacks and immoral behavior on the blockchain, and when that happens, how do we decide on the action  and how can we avoid being complicit with these behaviors if no action is taken?

While we don't have objective answers all we can have are philosophical shouting arguments. I do not wish this great community to fall down to this so I'd like to propose an idea. Voting by long term commitment.

It would work this way: when there is a Hard Fork proposal, you vote on it by locking your ether for a year IF the community adopts the decision you wish. As soon as the decision is taken, those who voted against that particular decision are free to get out, while those who voted for need to live with the consequences of this decision.

[I coded a very simple (less than 20 LoC) contract showing how it could be done](https://gist.github.com/alexvandesande/14ac3d15fc955b56ca40ab278b91cf7a).

**This is different than proof of stake vote** as this isn't a way for a machine to reach consensus, but a way to get information of the market confidence in each proposal. This allows everyone in the ecosystem to participate on the vote: client developers need to code each fork with the contract as a trigger, miners and exchanges need to comply by adopting it, exchanges need to accept it and holders need to vote. This would prevents some obvious silly loopholes from being accepted, like one that simply creates a new account with a trillion ether that votes on it.

The fork with the most ether locked up is the one where the market has more long term confidence. It's also the most valuable, because it reduces the supply available temporarily, so there's a self interest reason for miners to adopt that one. This also removes one of the largest problems with pure stake voting: since voting means losing liquidity, if you are wealthy to influence the vote, you will also be locked for a year and won't be able to sell it. 

I present this because I believe governance is paramount and I don't want this community to be split apart from this discussion. I also would like to hear counter arguments on why this is a bad idea and alternative proposals that would also allow a governance model that doesn't fall on the risk of the wealthiest 1% having total control of everyone else, nor one that would allow an angry majority mob to take the property of a disliked minority.

Some game theory counter arguments I've thought about this: first there's a prisoner's dilemma. There is an opportunity cost to vote and while the best outcome is achieved if everyone does it, your particular incentive is not to do it. Second, there's the risk of someone taking a big loan in ether, shorting on the market, voting on a proposal he knows to be bad for the currency and then profiting from the following catastrophe.

Any other ideas?

I have noticed that there is some confusion regarding the so called ""difficulty bomb"" and how exactly it will affect block discovery time.

I've read posts claiming it will halt the network in 6 or 12 months.  

The most reputable source of information I have found is this post by /u/vbuterin:

https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4iozgf/in_around_14_month_the_difficulty_bomb_will_make/d30c0lq

(but even that seems slightly off to me, more on that later)


***

# Premise #2

How does the difficulty adjustment currently work?

The current full specifications can, of course, be found in the [Yellow Paper](http://gavwood.com/paper.pdf).  
More specifically, in section 4.4.4 of the paper.

A friendlier description can be found in [EIP-2](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2.mediawiki):

&gt; `block_diff = parent_diff + parent_diff // 2048 * max(1 - (block_timestamp - parent_timestamp) // 10, -99) + int(2**((block.number // 100000) - 2))`  
where `//` is the integer division operator, eg. `6 // 2 = 3`, `7 // 2 = 3`, `8 // 2 = 4`

In vaguely human speech 😂:

* To calculate the difficulty for a new block...
* ... make it equal to the difficulty of the parent block, then:
  * if our new block has been found less than 10s after the parent block, __add__ 1/2048th of the parent block difficulty
  * if our new block has been found between 20s and 29s after the parent block, __subtract__ 1/2048th of the parent block difficulty
  * if our new block has been found between 30s and 39s after the parent block, __subtract__ 2/2048th of the parent block difficulty
  * ...
  * if our new block has been found between 990s and 999s after the parent block, __subtract__ 98/2048th of the parent block difficulty
  * if our new block has been found after 1000s after the parent block, __subtract__ 99/2048th of the parent block difficulty
* ... on top of that, add a difficulty increment of 2^([sequence number of our new block]/100000-2) (that division rounds down to the integer)  
Basically, it doubles every 100k blocks.  
For example:  
  * at block #1200000: 2^10 = 1024
  * at block #1300000: 2^11 = 2048
  * ...
  * at block #1700000: 2^15 = 32768
  * at block #1800000 (i.e. soon from now): 2^16 = 65536

In slightly more human speech:

There are two ""forces"" acting on the difficulty:

* One is the ""adjustment"": it changes the difficulty up or down so that the average block time stays between 10 and 20 seconds (this normally causes an average between 14 and 15 seconds: it's not exactly 15 seconds because block time has a statistical bias towards 0).  
Note, though, that the maximum ""pull down"" the adjustment can apply is proportional to the current difficulty. In particular, it's `-99/2048 * difficulty` (this happens when a block is discovered 1000+ seconds from its parent).
* The other is the ""difficulty bomb"": it doubles every 100k block and is not based on the current difficulty.

***

# What is going to happen

There are two phases:

1. The pressure from the difficulty bomb is smaller than 99/2048th of the ""natural difficulty"" (i.e. how difficult blocks would be if there were no bomb: it vaguely represents how powerful the mining network is).  
In this phase the difficulty bomb is simply not felt much at all.
2. The pressure from the difficulty bomb is greater than 99/2048th of the ""natural difficulty"": every time the difficulty bomb increases, block difficulty will increase until the two forces are in equilibrium (and at that point blocktime will get longer and longer each 100k, increasing forever).

***

Why did I claim that /u/vbuterin's estimates were slightly off in that post?

He used an example of 2^45 natural difficulty. That means that at 2^45 difficulty miners find blocks with an average between 14 and 15 seconds.

Let's calculate the maximum adjustment for it:

2^45 * 99 / 2048 = 2^45 * 99 / 2^11 = 99 * 2^34

He says:

&gt; At block 3.5m (1 year from now), we would have an equilibrium block time of 25s for 100k blocks (~1 month)

At block 3500000 the difficulty bomb would be 2^33.
That's 99*2 times smaller than the maximum adjustment, so equilibrium should still be around 15s, not so far as 25s.

So I decided to check it for myself...

# Blocktime simulator

Between yesterday and today I wrote an Ethereum blocktime simulator:  
https://github.com/giact/ethereum-blocktime-simulator/blob/master/ethereum-blocktime-simulator.py

I took into consideration mining power increase over time (I used a simple linear function).

My result is that difficulty will increase a bit more mildly than predicted by Vitalik, but his assessment that it will get annoying by 2017 seems correct.

This is what I get by using today's network mining power, __without__ mining power increase over time:  
https://gist.github.com/giact/3fd93ace0bfd771df11e7b9d20f9c080  
TL;DR: we reach 30s block time in 2017-07; 60s in 2017-12; 120s in 2018-09

And this is factoring in an increase of mining power of 9.18 Tera per month:  
https://gist.github.com/giact/a2e372bcda089069fad4c44d4b5414db  
TL;DR: we reach 30s block time in 2017-08; 60s in 2018-01; 120s in 2018-12

# Overview

In the coming weeks/months I'm going to be focusing on the following efforts in roughly the following order.  As with any plan, this is subject to change as things natually evolve.

# Package List

* `pyrlp` - https://github.com/ethereum/pyrlp/
    * Python implementation of the RPL encoding/decoding that is used across the ethereum ecosystem.
* `pyethereum` - https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum
    * The primary Ethereum library
    * used heavily by Vitalik for research purposes
    * used by *most* python/ethereum packages
* `ethereum-tester-client` https://github.com/pipermerriam/ethereum-tester-client
    * Standalone rough *copy* of the ABI encoding/decoding functionality found in `ethereum.abi` (This doesn't require any system dependencies to install).
* `eth-testrpc` https://github.com/pipermerriam/eth-testrpc/
    * Originally authored by ConsenSys
    * Now maintained by myself.
    * Testing dependency for most of the other python libraries I've written.
* JSON-RPC clients:
    * `ethereum-rpc-client` https://github.com/pipermerriam/ethereum-rpc-client
    * `ethereum-ipc-client` https://github.com/pipermerriam/ethereum-ipc-client
    * `ethereum-abi-utils` https://github.com/pipermerriam/ethereum-abi-utils

* `ethereum-contract` https://github.com/pipermerriam/ethereum-contract
    * A Python interface for interacting with ethereum contracts.
    * Underlying code can use any of the JSON-RPC clients.
* `populus` https://github.com/pipermerriam/populus
    * Command line tool for contract development
* `web3.py` https://github.com/pipermerriam/web3.py
    * A python library that implements the functionality found in `web3.js`.

# Tasks

## 1. - Python 3 Compatability

Make all of these libraries compatable with python 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5.

## 2. - Convert `eth-testrpc` to use `ethereum-tester-client`

As I worked to make `eth-testrpc` python 3 compatable I found that most of what I was writing was already present in `ethereum-tester-client`.  I'll be converting this library to just be a wrapper around the `ethereum-tester-client` code serving the responses over the HTTP JSON-RPC interface.

## 3. - Convert `ethereum-contract` to conform to [EIP68](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/68)

Assuming EIP68 is happening, convert the `Contract` object from that codebase to conform to the new contract interface.

## 4. - Change `populus` to use `ethereum-abi-utils` and `ethereum-contract`

Both the `ethereum-abi-utils` library and the `ethereum-contract` library are extracted from `populus`.  Complete this extraction to simplify the `populus` codebase.

## 5. - Extract `geth` utilities from `populus`.

Populus has some useful code written around running `geth` as a subprocess.  This is worth extracting into it's own library so it's re-usable elsewhere (and hopefully better tested).

## 6. - Extract `solc` utilities from `populus`.

Populus has some useful code written around compiling Solidity code with `solc` via a subprocess.  This is worth extracting into something standalone so that it is re-usable (and better tested).

## 7. - Deprecate `ethereum-tester-client`, `ethereum-rpc-client`, and `ethereum-ipc-client` in favor of using `web3.py`.

This is going to be a significant chunk of work because a lot of code is written assuming the common API presented across the tester/rpc/ipc client libraries.  I think however that the `web3.py` interface is better documented and better understood by the development community so I'd like to consolidate the tooling to use that one common library.

# Chores

These are things that will likely happen along the way but it's still a bit unclear on what the right way to do them is.

## 1. Unify the hex representation and handling of byte-string data.

* Ensure that all hex strings are returned with `0x` prefixes.
* Ensure that all public APIs which take string arguments force them to a `bytes` representation at the earliest stage possible.
* Ensure that all string return values are `bytes` representations.

Maybe extract all of this stuff into a utils library so that it's easier for all of the libraries to handle these things in a sane and unified manner.

# Want to Help?

If you'd like to help here are some ways you can assist.

* The `solc` and `geth` extractions are doable today.  Largely just copy/pasting the code and refactoring the test coverage to work for the new package.  I'll do all the python package setup for you if you'd like to take this on.
* Pick one of these tasks and start on it.  Some of them are already partially underway so check the open Pull Requests first.  The Python3 stuff is probably the lowest hanging fruit.
* Give me feedback on this list.",1466795015

3152,ethereum,A call to arms (Mine for the referendum!),"The 'exodus' of Ethereum miners which has been progressively worsening the past few days is exactly what we don't need right now - considering the fast approaching miner referendum in which miners will decide the response to the DAO hack, if any at all.


Many have strong views in this debate, and great discussions are going on within the Ethereum community as I type this, however, at the end of the day no-matter the consensus of the community - it’s the miners vote that count. The recent downsizing of miners combined with the imminent referendum has created a doubly whammy of sorts, a crisis situation - worse, the situation is hardly being discussed.


As many of you know, the fate of the network is resting solely in the hands of those mining Ethereum in the coming days, they are the ones who will decide the response to the DAO hack, if any at all. I’ve spoken to a few in-the-know people on the matter and they have related to my concerns; it's possible that big money / special interests, through an abundance of hash power, could effectively 'push' the vote to result in the outcome of their choosing - effectively thwarting the will of the majority.

As I see it, the only viable way to deter this from happening is for there to be an influx of individual miners on the network for when the referendum begins. If your an Ethereum believer, there's no better time to assist then now - when she needs you most!

The more individual miners on the network when voting begins, the better the chances are of reaching an outcome the consensus prefers. More important then generating daily Ethereum (which could be worth a fortune in the future), you're helping the network where &amp; when she needs you most, in the most invaluable of ways. If you’ve got an opinion on the matter, there's little better way to further your cause then mining your vote!

We musn't allow the consensus to be undermined, if Ethereum fails this greatest of tests, and the will of the consensus is thwarted - it would be a failure of epic proportions that I don't see us recovering from. On the other hand, if community participation in the vote is adequate and the consensus wins the day, it will be the best victory we've had yet :)

3165,ethereum,"CasualCoin, meta coin for ordinary people.","In light of the DAO situation, I've fully realised, how scary the law of ""immutable, unstoppable, and irrefutable computer code"" can get and how divorced it is from the malleable reality of human life. I think that most ordinary people would find a world, in which someone can irreversibly lose their life savings because their private key was stolen or lost, unacceptable. The DAO will be probably saved by the community, but ordinary Joe won't get that privilege. If blockchain currencies aspire to be the universal store of value and tool of exchange, they should be humanised. 

That got me thinking about designing a meta coin, that would have in some way softer rules than ordinary cryptocurrencies. This basic idea could mean many things, but the main one I have in mind right now is **wallet recoverability**. When creating a wallet, the owner would nominate other key holders (family, close friends etc.), who would have the ability to move all funds from his wallet to some other address by a multi-sign process. To be effective, this of course have to be paired with withdrawal limits, an ability to remove and add the trusted people and other measures.

That's the gist of it, if you have some other ideas what attributes could a ""more human"" coin posses, I would like to hear them. And if you know of some similar projects, please post them too.

3168,ethereum,Call for research into transaction censorship resistance,"Irrespective of how current events play out, they've brought up a valid concern of politically motivated soft-forks in the future.

Bitcoin is already in a position where mining is heavily concentrated in China, creating a risk that the Chinese government could step in to enforce ignoring transactions they don't want confirmed. Assuming enough hashpower for a 51% attack is vulnerable, it would effectively force a soft-fork.

Even once it's moved to PoS, Ethereum is similarly vulnerable in the case that a majority of Ether is controlled by actors operating within collaborating jurisdictions. Specifically jurisdictions that would collaborate in forcing a soft-fork to censor transactions they're opposed to.

It needs to be possible for a minority consensus to both identify participation in a 51% attack and exclude attackers from further participation in the network or a defensive fork of it. PoS makes this considerably more viable as the means of the attack can be easily confiscated by the network provided they are clearly identified.

3200,ethereum,My Personal Statement On TheDAO Hack. Inside Job Of First Magnitude Or How U Made Slocks Two By Four Into Four By Eight.,"You are seeing and hearing what you have been shown. Your perception is dictated by non crypto related political bummer undernourished founder paid articles marasmus and whoever is in control of your monies.

Some got brains in their skullsockets.

Some got crap. Some see a pen me sees a harpoon. Some wear on pink glasses thinking the snow is black.

I'm gonna get this shit straight now.

**There is NO hack. There is NO attacker here. I'm sure as fuck that TheDao has never been prone to this attack in any shape or form despite what u have been told.**

Outlets tell you that money slipped out from the dao as if it was recursively called by a cosplitter or whoever voted yes on #59 I dont care shit about it, by the means of encircling multiple payouts into a single split and hence a hacker to suck $50 million token equivalent off the genuine dao and lock them out in the childdao they control.

The complexity and nonsenical awareness of solidity and smart contract thingy narrows down the list we're looking at to 50-100 people that might have had enough technical savvy to pave the way with conducting such an attack. So it unlikely was an outsider. It was those whose eth you're buying. I dont imply a concrete individual. Its those who you trust with your money whose crowdfunding you support, being defensive at snip intrasub criticism and orgasmic at noob posts showing admiration toward initiative that protects ur investment.

Now what, you got pwned and squeak over here as a little piggy that lost moms tit.

**The market is long gone.**

Why? For the reason above. The economic principles behind the widespread distribution underlying this particular asset have been buried under the commandments spoken to you by 11 million contract meant to channel the final say on the economic state of this little commonwealth. Any future event, any fundamental change of the perception of ether will be the cause of what 200 million contract says.

U got a lead on ur neck put by those who u think are abounding in love when they say failsaved themselves after whitehating ur funds.

For those stupid yes, its 11+ million and not 7.63 as if whitehat money dwells in the white dao and remainder is in the ""dark"" dao.

**There is no bad ""dark"" dao and nice ""white"" dao.**

Theres one local loop here that keeps your monies and has you sightless to your own ignorance. 

**Tual is a goat.**

Tual + slock.it crew, and possibly ethcore folks, all those involved in the dao hoax or happened to be the ones in-the-know including, but not limited to, folks from eth foundation their employed ""security experts"" and everyone that is/was connected to this scam somehow, shorted both dao and eth.

Hellz you guys got both balls here, I think you do regain a considerable margin over dr. craig wright self-PR attention-seeking story. Will write a novelle about it, all profits from ether shorts to the motion picture industry, book the flight to hollywood and make a movie based on that novelle.

**The above few paragraphs are exhaustive for deriving what motivation dao hoaxers are led by and what purposes it serves.**

Rather than broaden eth ecosystem by investing in VC dapp stratups, your dao is headed toward laundering as much token value as I-have-no-fucking-word-to-describe-how much-is-this in a way that your ""attack"" which I'm deadly sure is not an attack, has been a bliss cash grab for slockit to make millions off ur arses and various no risk averse noobs.

Ah, I already told there are NO white purple black hats here. Again, your fucking attack was performed by them that are frequent at feeding u cum oozz till u either get tired or love it.

Take care, and I dont know if this gag resolves by itself, but you got fucked so lamentably that its beyond words how low you are .

**TL;DR** The DAO was not hacked. No whitehats or darkhats distinguishable from each other tell good from evil in a sense that it makes the difference as to where the money travels at this very moment tomorrow or aftertomorrow cause it was all long the way in the possession of the only dao u have trusted with ur money.

It was a [confidence trick.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick) Inside job. Instigated by those whose pickle u tickle.

**Create a fake VC fund that ""certificates"" a token build on top of the confidence loop you trust as a valuable one, sell this fuck for $200,000,000, imitate the defraud conspiracy by moving dumb money into a separate account.

3202,ethereum,"Whether we fork or not, please be more careful with your investments in the future","There were three Big Problems with The DAO:

The first big problem was obviously Slock.it's buggy code. They marketed their code as safe, even on Facebook, and a lot of community members believed them.

The second big problem was the size of The DAO. Again, Slock.it takes a lot of blame here—they heavily marketed it. Also, the Ethereum foundation shoulders some blame for tacitly endorsing this project and for allowing their members to become embroiled in it. Conflicts of interest galore.

The third issue, which many DAO investors don't want to hear is this: **the core idea behind The DAO was deeply flawed from the start.**

The DAO was set up to invest in startup-like projects focused on Ethereum. That's fine. I for one think there will be plenty of great investment opportunities to invest in ETH-focused startups.

The biggest problem, in my mind, was the structure of the fund. Popular vote seems like an awful way to decide on which startups to invest in.

Startup investment takes diligence. You have to research the team behind the startup, the size of the market, and need to have some understanding of how the product will reach the intended audience. You just can't expect that level of dedication from every voting member.

Also, the size of the fund was problematic. Anyone who works in venture capital can tell you that the larger the fund size, the more difficult it is to make a profit. That's because the bulk of venture returns come from a tiny minority of investments. It's not uncommon for a fund to lose money on 19/20 investments, but make it all back and then some on 1/20. Any given investment must in theory be able to return the entire fund.

The amount invested in a startup must to be weighed against the total fund size. If, for example, if you raise $150 million, and make a ton of small investments, you're unlikely to book a return. Also, if you make investments in various sizes: some in small amounts, others in millions, it's likely you won't make the most of the 1 or 2 big returns in your portfolio. A lot of investment funds have a standard investment size for this reason.

Finally, there's nothing stopping a USD-based venture capital firm or a mutual fund from setting up a popular vote based fund. They don't do it because it's a deeply flawed idea. It's a bad idea, and you don't even need a decentralized platform to test it out.

To return a large investment fund you need planning, diligence, and strategy. You just can't expect that from ""the wisdom of the crowds"".

The idea behind The DAO will crop up again. Please don't waste your money on it a second time. If and when a meaningful business pops up based on ethereum, I seriously doubt you'll have to be a member of such a scheme to invest in it. There's no sense in clumping your money together when you can make independent picks and avoid hivemind investing.

They also have been touting low TDP (under 150w on the RX 480) and a high performance (between an R9 390 and Fury, according to leaked benchmarks). It sounds like a miner's dream card, but the hashrate is ultimately unknown, and I don't have the ability to buy a few and test them out.

If anyone could post here what hashrates they're getting on these cards (particularly the RX480 or RX470 4gb), I'm sure it would help all of us out. They're being released on June 29th

Better yet, if someone has a review version of the card and can report the hashrate without breaking the NDA, that would be even better.",1466879615

http://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/4prseb/looking_for_some_fresh_new_crypto_apparel_youre/

My name is Rich, and I wanted to stop by to share with you guys and gals something I've been working on for a few weeks.

WWW.CRYPTOSCLOSET.COM

You may have seen this post on Reddit where I was asking the community about what style of apparel they would like to see and I was blown away with 75+ votes from around the world in about 10 hours.

I have a local friend with a design studio and he has agreed to be my full time support and pledged to help my fulfill customer orders (up to 500 shirts) a day. 

Just a few pictures of the studio.

CryptosCloset Webite is still "" under construction "" - but fully equipped with the essentials such as payment processors ( Coinpayments &amp; Paypal ) and a very nice 4GB + 2GB burst VPS running it in the background ready to handle any and all traffic.

I have been in the Crypto Space for quite a long time ( about 5 years now ) and I have been working my ass off any many projects close to my heart.

One of these projects is WWW.TOSHIDESK.COM - A social charting platform.

I come here today to let you all know that CryptosCloset has already began making sales.

Just to name a few -

One of the coolest ETH MINERS I've had the pleasure of recently meeting has bought a couple 

shirts already 

His ETH Mine:

One of his tweets confirming his order: 

- https://twitter.com/prodjkc/status/745294086723145728

Here is a shot of the actual shirts he ordered that I shipped out today and should arrive at his 

doorstep MONDAY!!!

Another one of my customers met me on Reddit and I sent him a shirt as well for his fathers right 

before Fathers Day, and I paid $25 Overnight shipping for him to get it in time. 

This customer was: https://www.reddit.com/user/weekapaughead

Looking to gain some more fans and customers and I figured I might come here and put the word 

out there a bit more. 

Here are a few shirts I currently have in stock:

http://imgur.com/a/GDx6A

Finishing up the content filler on the site such as stock photos and branding within the site...should be done within the next few days.

A few shots of the branding I'm talking about:

I'm currently accepting multiple crypto currencies as payment for apparel.

MTR, ETH, BTC, LTC, DOGE, PPC to name a few.

I'm also accepting Paypal and Credit Cards as well.

I have the ability to put any Crypto Logo / Wording / Designs on any Shirt, Polo, Hoodie, Tank Top - 

Jersey - Beanies - MousePads, You name it... as shown here - http://imgur.com/a/GDx6A

Please be apart of my vision to bring Crypto Apparel to the masses and I need you guys within this community to help me with that. 

There are a number of ways to support.

1) Become a customer - As I can get you any size you need with any design you prefer.

2) Spread the word on Social Media - Our Twitter is https://twitter.com/CryptosCloset

3) Reply back with any suggestions on how I can get in touch with Vitalik Buterin and his team so I can send them some shirts.

4) Check out the www.CryptosCloset.com website and let us know what you think so far!


READY TO ORDER? GREAT, LETS DO THIS!

I'm taking orders right now through Forum Threads ( BitcoinTalk and others ) / Email ( admin@cryptoscloset.com )  / Reddit / Twitter / Etc until the site is 100% done.

I have no problem using escrow if you wish.

I won't charge for USA shipping as I wish to pay it for you. It's just good business. International Orders contact me for a personal shipping quote as shipping for overseas gets a bit too expensive for me to front as I wouldn't even break even on the sale of the apparel. Hope you all understand that.

It was a pleasure passing along this info to you all, and hope to hear from many of you very soon.

3262,ethereum,Proposal for Stephan Tual to step down from his position at slock.it,"**Please keep this discussion rational and civil. That way, maybe some good will come out of it.**

Proposal: Stephan Tual, what would it take (petition, miner votes, etc.) to apologize for some of your previous statements and resign from Slock.it?

TLDR:
I believe Stephen Tual should no longer have any part in the continuation of the Slock.it team and further development of TheDAO. Before investing in future decentralized organizations and projects on Ethereum we should be more attentive to who the leaders of the project are. His actions have been detrimental to the ethereum community. I created ipfs.pics links in case Stephan takes down the twitter posts or blocks me from his twitter....
Stephan lacks humility and modesty. He has constantly promoted TheDAO and it’s strengths, giving credit to the Slock.it team. On the other hand he has taken no accountability for TheDAO’s shortcomings. The current version of TheDAO is a Slock.it developed project, for better or worse.

Supporting Arguments:
The attack potential and mitigations were first publicized well before TheDAO’s exploitation. Yet just days before the attack Stephan posted this: https://twitter.com/stephantual/status/743093798302015488
https://ipfs.pics/QmcMApxJQzfBm9W5HVfouRmpAc1qBcamQYZhPY16tGoH5M
As well as
https://blog.slock.it/no-dao-funds-at-risk-following-the-ethereum-smart-contract-recursive-call-bug-discovery-29f482d348b#.vb9ox51q8
This reference is almost a taunt to the unscrupulous members of the Ethereum community to attack TheDAO. Although to be clear, Stephan is not to be blamed for the thief’s work, he can only be blamed for his personal response. Now we can see that Stephan’s claims that the vulnerabilities were solved are a lie. I have yet to see Stephan recognize and apologize for this error.

After the attack Stephan was, in my opinion, overly aggressive. Attempts such as this, to secretly learn the identities of your opponents, are uncalled for. I’m disappointed that Stephen chose his idea of the correct course of action so soon, without openly discussing his thoughts with the community first. That is what we are here for.
https://twitter.com/slockitproject/status/743790901877706752
https://ipfs.pics/QmfXJ1ZzFZYx5sRnu4nbtCy81xffvnmJsE1t6as4WMXdBH
Stephan went on to make a statement to the New York Times which (seems to have been retracted?, “‘Thanks to a process called a ‘fork’ resulting from coordination with the Foundation, all stolen funds will be retrieved from the attacker,’ Mr. Tual wrote in an email.” It can also be found referenced here: http://www.pymnts.com/news/security-and-risk/2016/ethereum-virtual-currency-hack/
Just a few hours after the attack on June 17th Stephan made definitive reassurances such as this. At the moment this statement can still be found in the history on TheDAO slack: https://ip.bitcointalk.org/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FClJirlmWMAAyyef.jpg&amp;t=565&amp;c=jGB8xq0ol3bJ-g
These statements demonstrate Tual does not recognize Ethereum is an ecosystem which can operate independently and contrary to his wishes. I am implying that this statement was made without attention to the implications of treating Ethereum like a centralized system. There are high caliber suggestions and discussions taking place across the Ethereum ecosystem as a direct result of TheDAO attack. Stephan has demonstrated by his closed minded, definitive, statements that he does not recognize Ethereum is not a centralized entity.

In his statements Stephan does not acknowledge the demerits of a hardfork to return TheDAO token holder’s ether. The HF discussion is outside the scope of this post, but Stephan’s singular drive toward one regardless of the consequences is well within the scope.

Instead of taking responsibility, Stephan spreads misleading information. His posts on twitter and in blogs lack the nuances of the situation.:
https://twitter.com/stephantual/status/743764579805605888
https://ipfs.pics/QmeyhSXiDdLQfEZAnq7Vp7Xx2CLXKtTJjqpivFMWYSi3vF


In Stephan's writings he shifts all of the blame from the Slock.it team onto the thief. And he does not make any attempt to apologize or show any humility for the errors of TheDAO that just days before he claimed was able to “withstand all threats.” Here I reference the game card shown in Stephan’s tweet. Ethereum mainnet is by definition NOT the testnet. Real people staked real assets on the success of TheDAO. Just as those people stand to profit with TheDAO’s success, they stand to lose with TheDAO’s failure. Stephan Tual fails to recognize his own contribution to TheDAO’s failure. There is a term for this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning–Kruger_effect. I am disappointed that even in the wake of such a large scale hack, on what has become the largest crowdsale funded project in history he pushes forward as if everything is fine. Not yet.

I can continue if necessary, but I think this is enough to think about.

Conclusion:
I have great respect for Vlad, Christian Reitwiessner, Emin Gün Sirer, Shoraibit, and everyone else who called attention to the security vulnerabilities of TheDAO. I particularly enjoyed Vitalik’s personal response to this: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4oj7ql/personal_statement_regarding_the_fork/
I hope Stephan is taking notes.

Stephan has been detrimental to the development of TheDAO and to the Ethereum community. Jobs was fired from Apple and went on to become a legend. I hope the similar can one day be said of Stephan and Slock.it. I hope his reputation has not been permanently damaged. I would caution investors from investing in any project led by Stephan Tual in the future.

A. Are we now on a different chain, where after 27 days we exist on a chain where the funds are frozen, and the attacker on another where they are not?

OR

B. The SF keeps the chain whole, and the DAO frozen until further moves?

Another post made tonight envisions a scenario where the attacker on a smaller chain sends large payouts to top miner addresses. if they revert to the older chain to claim the funds, theAttacker's chain becomes the primary chain again. 

This is the scenario that scares most of us. How can we avoid it?

3282,ethereum,"H E R M I C I T Y - Big news, Land Secured For Pilot Hermicity","Hi everyone,
Extremely excited to announce that we are about to close a deal to secure land access for our pilot Hermicity.

We intend to put together financial documentation, other legal documentation, a development roadmap and a communication strategy and will overhall the main  [H E R M I C I T Y  website](http://hermicity.org) when it is all ready. From there we will open up to a formal community consultation process and once we are satisfied that there is confidence in our team and our plans we will go ahead and create a small smart contract to enable the crowdsale of funds for the development of this pilot Hermicity.

The investors in this property development will be entitled to a share of the rents paid by residents relative to their share of the funds raised. (For instance if your investment is 10% of the total funds raised for the project you will be entitled to 10% of the rent.) The payment of rent to the investors will be fully automated by the smart contract. And of course, the shares will be backed by tokens that will be tradable so your share is liquid - property ownership has never been so easy, liquid and transparent as  H E R M I C I T Y  will allow.

A little bit about this piece of land we have secured...

+ 3.5 Ha (8.5 acres)

+ includes exposed rock cliffs, waterfall, wilderness and breathtaking views from every angle

+ surrounded by wallabies, birds and other wildlife

+ sandstone outcrops, deep ravines and hazy blue eucalypt forests

+ 2 hours from Australia's largest city, Sydney (perfect for people looking to get away for the weekend)

+ fast internet access

+ privacy guaranteed, no neighbours in sight (or ear shot)

+ surrounded by the world heritage listed Blue Mountains National Park

+ [here are some pictures](http://imgur.com/a/ilrWz)

The purpose of this pilot Hermicity is to show the world the power of Ethereum to enact change in the physical (meatspace) world. Through the challenges we face when we build this pilot Hermicity we will be able to refine our vision and execution - culminating in a DAO and software library that anyone will be able to use to do property development all over the world using Ethereum.

3286,ethereum,A fork is a self-preservation feature of the network and shows the power - not weakness - of decentralization and concensus.,"A big part of game theory in cryptocurrency is the different actors having to make rational decisions to keep the value of their stakes high.

The problem with this particular bad-intended actor is that he has gained an astronomically big part of the tokens ( ether = a token) in the network with no interest in retaining that value.

He has received 5 (potentially 15 % ) at no cost and benefits through destroying Ethereum since it increases the value of his non-Ether coins (assumibly bitcoins).

Game theory in cryptocurrency is all about the actors having to act rational. Bad intended actors can disrupt these mechanics: effectively, he has now 5 to 15 % of Ethers to utilize in any negative way against Ethereum at no cost. We do not have to predict which the exact actions are that he can perform in the future to use against Ethereum. 

It's just important in itself to fix the status quo of the Ethereum network by undoing his power so the Ethereum eco-system is again in the fairer state it's coming from.

That's very important for the future and stability of the network and very much worth a fork. A fork in this case is a self-preservation of the network, therefore a very interesting and positive feature of the network.",1466942394

The app is super simple, you get doges for having the app open, then you can swipe up to send a doge out to someone else who has the app open. There aren't many free doges that come with it, but you can aquire around 10 doges a day if you leave the app open for 2 minutes every hour or so.

3334,ethereum,An argument against burning the hacked coins,"I hear quite a lot of non-DAO participants saying that the DAO investors should be ""punished"" so they can ""learn"" from their bad investment. They are in favor of burning the hacked coins. 

Ok, fair enough, I understand you see this as some kind of competition, I get it that this can be a normal initial reaction.

But. Let's pause here for a second and think about this.


The DAO was meant as a giant crowd-sourcing fund that would launch hundreds of startups where each one of them would work on a project that could be beneficial for Ethereum, projects that could boost the Ethereum eco-system.

We are talking about funds for the creation of actual useable applications running on Ethereum, which would lead to an increase of demand for the tokens required to run these applications: your ethers, currently sitting in your cold wallet.

We are talking about the burning of highly liquid coins, not being hold somewhere in a cold wallet, but coins that would've been moving around to actually grow the Ethereum eco-system.


So what you are asking for is taking these coins and burning them, just to ""teach"" all the previous holders of these coins ""a lesson"".

Ok, so what lesson are you trying to teach these investors exactly? 

""DO NOT INVEST YOUR COINS IN STARTUPS THAT BOOST THE ECOSYSTEM THAT WOULD INCREASE THE VALUE OF ETHER"" ?

If that is the lesson you want to teach, by all means, keep preaching the burning of those coins.

Some more respect for this ""other"" type of investors might be suitable.

3341,ethereum,What comes after the Fork?,"I've been thinking about what comes next.   And I’m thinking that everyone’s looking too closely at the prospect of being paid back, arguing for forks and so on, but nobody has stepped back to consider how it could unfold. And when.

TLDR, it’s all well and good to be discussing forks, but we should really be thinking about the knives, and how long it will be until anyone eats.

So far, we’ve argued moral hazard, and morals, and remediation. We argued trust and truth and purpose.  We argued whether contracts are determined by the code, or by the spirit, and the irony of the spirit being that they are to be determined by the code…  we’ve argued… and did not really get anywhere.   What that tells me is that this is an arguable situation.  Any time I see an arguable future with a fortune at stake, I know there will be lawyers.

So, with a fair degree of certainty, I predict that the very next piece of cutlery to come out of the drawer will the knives, by which lawyers for those damaged and lawyers for those culpable, and curators, and lawyers for the curators, and lawyers for others, will slice up the carcass.

The chances of everyone involved in theDAO being made completely whole are approximately zero.  No matter what happens, some DTHs (or governments on their behalf) are going to call foul and litigate.  There are so many conflicted interests, so many individuals who stepped over lines (or around them), and so many people who acted… and so much money has burned in the process… it just won’t be possible to return it all, and there are too many big fat targets...

It’s not a matter of “if” there’s litigation, it’s a matter of who sues, why, when, who they go after, and in what jurisdiction(s). It’s a risk bordering on certainty, we might as well treat it as a foregone conclusion and plan accordingly.  When it comes to litigation, the key determinants are who has the most to lose, and where is the money.  The folks with the most to lose are curating the DAO, and directing where the ether goes, and the ""white hats"".  And the biggest target is theDAO itself.  They  (curators, white hats) will therefore find a way to direct some, if not all of theDAO’s ether to lawyers.   

This can’t all conclude overnight, because most jurisdictions allow people time to bring suit.  Years.  So the threat of litigation is a ticking time bomb for the entire duration of whatever limitation periods have (or will have) started ticking. 

I've read DTHs anticipating payout in a few weeks. Ha.   That's optimistic.

This isn't a new situation. When a 150 M$ VC fund liquidates, a good fraction is held in “escrow” by the lawyers as surety against the costs of future potential litigation, even when nobody expects it.   Same is going to happen here too.  Except that the probability of litigation is known to be pretty sure bet, and since this whole thing consciously decided to step across international boundaries and around decades of legal precedent, the size of the potential legal furball might easily chew up a hundred million dollars, or about everything that the “white hats” have under their control.  Particularly when (not if) various governments get involved on behalf of their injured citizens! 
	
Additionally, by choosing to fork, soft or hard, the miners could make themselves complicit in any residual damages, to any person.  Including our intrepid hacker, depending on who does what. I don’t have to take a position on the legitimacy of such a claim to know that it will be expensive, regardless of merit, and regardless of outcome.   

If there’s a hard fork, lawsuit exposure from the “blackhat” goes to certainty because the snappy dresser has arguments that cannot be dismissed at summary judgment, and a lot at stake.  

So, no…  I don’t see a hard fork returning ether to everybody and then everyone shaking hands and saying “Great, we all learned, let’s go make Ethereum great…”.  

Here’s how I see it:

Soft fork:  The folks at slock.it use the DAO ether to pay the lawyers to keep from being sued into destitution in every jurisdiction on the planet, and, after a long time, offer to return pennies on the dollar to DTHs on the condition that they agree to give up some (all) of their rights to seek additional compensation. The initial version will be crafted with too much legal protection to slock.it and will be challenged, litigated - possibly even subject to a class action. Blackhat anonymously assigns his stake to a troll lawyer who sues the snot out of everyone he finds, just because.  Various other opportunistic lawsuits settle.  If it doesn't settle, we can all spend a decade watching things wind through appeals.  DTHs maybe get a few pennies when the dust settles.  If they don't die of old age first.

Hard fork:  DTHs all get reimbursed with Eth that isn’t worth what it was when they bought it. The hard fork is used as evidence of a de-facto determination of fault, and Slock.it is sued into oblivion. Black hat sells his share to a troll lawyer who sues everyone, including the miners for conspiring to cause him injury without color of right, and everyone lives through half a decade of legal nightmare, paying lawyers out of their pockets. 

So clearly, not hard fork – because that would mean that miners decide to consciously step up to the plate of a lawsuit… the majority of which are organized, and can afford to get decent legal advice (assuming they are smart enough to seek it). 

That’s how I see the end game.  Curious as to other opinions…

3346,ethereum,"Intent vs. Code is Law, Moving Forward","Reading time :  5 minutes

Most people would agree, the purpose of blockchain is to provide a better solution to the current system in place. Only something that is more efficient, transparent, offers more protection, and more opportunities to develop on, would make sense to replace/operate alongside a system which doesn’t offer such things to the same degree.

So what is a contract? Firstly, it establishes an agreement creating obligations between one or more parties. For a contract on the blockchain to take place, you have two additional pieces of information, the coder of the contract and the author of it. Sometimes those individuals are the same, but not always. Many people go by the ideology that code is law. But should that be the case in every circumstance moving forward? If an author wants a contract developed and hires someone to code it for them, but the coder mistakes the intent of the author in his coding, should this new code be law, replacing the author’s original intent? Or what if the author codes his own contract? If a mistake in code was made, since the author is the one who coded it, should that mean it was necessarily their intent? But this can be easily refuted. In the situation of the DAO, many experts reviewed the code and missed the error and it was by far not in slock.it’s best interest to have such error be their original intent.

There is definitely a difference between code and intent. In an ideal world, where programmers embody an intellect of perfection, then code and intent may very well be the same. Unfortunately for now, that isn’t the case.

So in terms of blockchain doing better than the current system in regards to programmers and authors, a blockchain that supports the intent of the author would be more useful.

What about the opposite end, the users, or party entering said contract? What is better for them? If intent is what matters most in terms of author but the user doesn’t know author’s intent, only their code, which things should users be accountable for? One could easily argue a person entering a contract should understand the coding line by line. If you don’t understand or agree with it, you shouldn’t enter said contract. But is this reasonable? If a person loses money, property, or whatever is entailed in the contract, should they be the only ones liable? There are many intelligent people, especially in the blockchain space. However, it is easy to argue that very few have an in depth understanding and knowledge of blockchain programming. If experts can miss a flaw, what chances do common users have? Now magnify that x100, x1000, x10,000, when this market grows outside this niche community. Some trust needs to exist between users and the experts who review the contract. But as the DAO showed, this isn’t enough. Perfection does not exist and sometimes errors go unnoticed. And until some “cookie cutter” code for contracts is available and not only extensively reviewed, but tested in the real world many many times over (with hopefully much less capital than the DAO raised), will this problem gradually get better.

In conclusion, absent of those who hope to exploit the system, which sort of defeats the purpose of a “better” system, where does that leave us? Which is more beneficial to everyone, authors and users and thereby the platform, code is law or intent matters? I briefly mentioned in another thread that although I believe in hard forks in extenuating circumstances, I understand the anti-fork crowd explaining the immutability of the ledger. Developers would want their code to run un-meddled with.  But I doubt that would be true if it wasn’t as they intended. Easy example is slock.it team being in support of a hard fork to correct the DAO distaster. Users benefit from intent as well. Through no necessary fault of their own, most users will only understand the higher level aspects of a contract. The likelihood of this changing in the future is doubtful. Expert audits won’t always be sufficient. More robust reusable code that’s been exhaustively tested over time will help. Until then, and perhaps even later, intent does protect users.

I respect those in the camp that code is law and immutable. But at present there are still gaps that need to be filled before this becomes feasible. We are far from mass adoption even though great progress is being made.  It is important for a platform to be able to adapt, change, and innovate to succeed. I am also not of the opinion that forking of the chain be the norm. But for extreme circumstances, events that could be considered devastating to the overall health of the platform, intent matters.

tl;dr

Intent not only matters in blockchain contracts, it is beneficial to the platform and all its participants. Intent already plays a major part, and for good reason, in contract law. And while it’s good to question many aspects while trying to improve upon the existing system with blockchain, lets not reinvent the wheel.",1466979744

I propose that we add the ""serial"" keyword to solidity. When a contract is declared like ""serial contract myContract {"", we are guaranteed that all functions in the contract will be executed serially (no concurrency is possible, exact behavior as described above).

The problem is that every time I start it, it has different problems, or starts in different way... Totally unreliable. I didn't even manage to play with it, because of so much problematic start-ups.

The second thing is Geth - I don't know if you guys realize, but it has HUGE memory leak. When started it takes about 80 MB of memory, so that's fine. However, after about one day of working (i.e. downloading some blocks), it was using 1,6 GB of memory...

Macbeth boasts that he has no reason to fear Macduff, for he cannot be killed by any man born of woman. Macduff declares that he was ""from his mother's womb / Untimely ripp'd"" (V.8.15–16), (i.e., born by Caesarean section) and is not ""of woman born"" (an example of a literary quibble), fulfilling the second prophecy.

I’m going to say something unpopular, but I want those who disagree with me to understand that I say it with respect and even admiration since we are all together on this exciting trip with Ethereum, especially to those who have had a direct hand in bringing it to life over the past 2-3 years.

I’m disappointed about the soft fork.

I wasn’t sure where I stood on this whole issue until after the soft fork landed. My thought process went something like this, dating back to before the DAO launched.

Early May - “Oh, so this DAO thing is launching. It’s an interesting concept although I doubt the ability of ‘The Mob’ to pick good investments. I met Stephen and Christoph in London and I didn’t pick up any vibes that they’re bad people… maybe just a little over-eager. I’ll put in $1000 just to participate, which I would be OK with losing. ”

https://twitter.com/fivedogit/status/728423028649013248

Mid May - “I am completely stunned that the DAO raised $150 mil. Stephen is one of the best marketers I’ve ever seen. It’s a shame the underlying ideas for slock.it and DAO are flawed (in my opinion).” (Note: I told Christoph about my slock.it reservations to his face the first time I met him... Sorry! Hope I’m wrong!)

Mid-to-late May - “I see one category where the DAO could really cause disruption: social media. Social media products need a user base to get started -- a pain I’ve felt as a developer first-hand. The DAO investors are a ready and properly-incented army of day-1 users for whatever they decide to invest in. Imagine the investors of Oculus (which, yes, is social media) getting shares instead of a t-shirt or whatever. Potentially very powerful stuff.”

https://twitter.com/fivedogit/status/733364387793276928 

May 19th - Email to Solidity dev Christian Reitwiessner (Awesome guy and I want to clarify -- he deserves zero blame for the DAO fiasco. Solidity wasn’t “buggy”, just new, beta, whatever. Coder beware of what it does and doesn’t do.)

“Hey Christian. Long time, no talk. Thanks again for all the work you did (and are doing) on Solidity. $150 million in the DAO. No pressure!

Wanted to share this doc with you… [blah blah blah].”

Late May (27th, to be exact) - Email to a well-placed friend in crypto re: an unrelated Ethereum idea:

“Yeah no problem. 
 
BTW Vlad Zamfir (the casper proof of stake guy) just dropped a huge mic on The DAO. Detailed all the attack vectors and, most damningly, why the DAO's voting mechanisms discourage ""no"" votes and will lead to shitty investments. 
 
http://hackingdistributed.com/2016/05/27/dao-call-for-moratorium/
 
So maybe The DAO is not the right way to do this [idea]. But it needs to exist, one way or the other.
 
Cyrus”

Note: I knew Vlad from DEVCON1, no disrespect to his colleagues for not mentioning them, especially Emin Gun Sirer. 

Thoughts at this time: “Vlad spends all day, every day thinking about crypto consensus attacks. I trust him when he says the DAO is flawed. How soon can I get my money out?”

May 29th - “I’m more comfortable with geth than any of the graphical clients. Let me figure out how to transfer my DAO tokens to an exchange.”

http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/4419/how-do-i-transfer-from-the-dao-to-an-exchange-using-linux-and-geth-from-the-term/4420#4420 

Early June - “ETH price going nuts! Mars, baby!”

https://twitter.com/fivedogit/status/743530842513940484 

June 12th - “Holy shit! The DAO was hacked?! Wait… why is the price of ETH dropping? There’s nothing wrong with Ethereum itself! Fuck me for not anticipating the damage the DAO could cause to ETH.”

https://twitter.com/fivedogit/status/744200034460246016 (a few days later)

June 12th afternoon - “Well I’m grateful I got out. I should thank the researchers who warned everyone.”

https://twitter.com/fivedogit/status/743858968204808192 
https://twitter.com/fivedogit/status/744947104620093440 

After the hack, my opinion (and emotions) on the subject were all over the place. I went from grateful &amp; proud I knew to get out to sad for those who lost funds to slightly troll-y against those who lept without looking.

https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4oq9bb/goethereum_pull_request_geth_modified_to_recover/ 

It’s no exaggeration to say that I, one who is usually decisive given any particular issue, went back and forth between fork and anti-fork a half-dozen times. My circular thought pattern went something like this:

“Wow. I guess the DAO did have flaws. I’ve been burned on investments in the past, got educated this time and got out. Goodie on me. Others should have too. Forking would be the 2008 bailouts all over again. Everybody wanted to get rich quick and the risks caught up with them.”

“But it’s theft, regardless. Just because someone left their house door open doesn’t mean you can go in and take everything.”

“Is it theft though? ‘Code is law’, right? They said it themselves on their website.”

“For Ethereum’s sake, the hacker shouldn’t be allowed to control 10+% of the supply.”

“But getting away from centralized control is the whole point of crypto. We shouldn’t be fixing bugs in single contracts, no matter how much was at stake.”

“Yeah, but reductio ad absurdum, what if the attacker were ISIS. Wouldn’t you be against giving ISIS $50+ mil?”

And on and on.

I remained undecided until today as the soft fork looks to be the new law of the land. 

What we just witnessed was oligarchy. Plain and simple. 

Those with the most to lose from the DAO controlled the right levers of power to push through the soft fork without any substantive “vote”: the ethereum client devs, the mining pools, etc. There were some token attempts at letting miners choose which way to mine, but, in practice, the default was to support the soft fork. In a landscape where *most* participants don’t fully know what they’re doing, they’re going to simply go with the defaults. Heck, I’m a reasonably seasoned Dapp developer and even I haven’t read through all of the geth options. Defaults will always win!

Yes, some clients and pools were more “democratic” than others, but it didn’t matter. If 50% of the “choice” is hardcoded “yes” and 50% of the remaining half is default “yes” with an opt-out, then the vote is already over. (Yes, I know these percentages are probably wildly inaccurate. Point remains the same.)

On its merits and regarding the moral choice of the hack, I guess you could say I’m still undecided. But to witness an oligarchic choice made from the top down to save The Haves makes my stomach turn, even when many of those Haves are probably not even 1 year into being millionaires. Most people have to live with their mistakes. And these mistakes are very real and very painful -- people lose jobs, spouses, money, you name it... and almost never get do-overs.

But apparently, even in crypto where it wasn’t supposed to be the case, the rich get to Etch-a-sketch their blunders and draw all over again. ",1467043511

There's one ESSENTIAL question that I'm not sure I have a perfect understanding of:

**Will DAO Token Holders be able to retrieve their ETH from the DAO only after a hard fork, or will it be possible to retrieve them after a soft fork (aka in 4 days).**

My understanding of the soft fork is that it will essentially freeze all the ETH in the DAO, meaning that it can't be moved anywhere as the miners wouldn't validate any transactions coming from those wallets. My understanding of a hard fork was that the ETH **could** be withdrawn by people who owned DAO tokens. Several comments have suggested that it will be possible to withdraw ETH in 4 days, though, meaning that a flood of ETH may find its way to the market before I expected.

Can someone provide a definitive answer about when the DAO's ETH may return to the market? I couldn't find an authoritative source outlining this, so if anyone is aware of one, I would sincerely appreciate it if they could share.",1467045091

Of course there are minor pullbacks before each next move up, (https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=ethereum&amp;date=today%2012-m&amp;cmpt=date&amp;tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B4), but generally things are looking very good as far as growing public perception.

When I look at the google trends, it gives me reason to feel very confident as an Ethereum Investor. Anyone who's investing in Eth is shouldering significant risk, but it truly looks like things are going to pan out well for us hodlers. 

Another thing I noticed, and something that gives me great hope for the future of Ethereum, is the regional interest. Whereas ""bitcoin"" has the highest search interest from 3rd world countries, a.k.a the ""developing world"", ""Ethereum"" has the highest search interest from the Western World. I'm not trying to be racist, or bigoted, but it makes me feel even MORE confident in Ethereum when you notice this and think about it's implications. This seems to show that Ethereum is more accepted by the ""mainstream"" western culture than bitcoin is. This is very important because an unavoidable truth is that if Ethereum is to succeed like we want it to, it MUST be adopted and accepted by the mainstream western world. 

The top 5 countries for ""bitcoin"" on google trends:
1. Ghana
2. Estonia
3. Slovenia
4. Czech Republic
5. South Africa

Conversely, the top 5 countries searching for ""Ethereum"" are:
1. Netherlands
2. Canada
3. Australia
4. USA
5. Germany

To me, this seems to show that Ethereum is more accepted by the ""mainstream"" western culture than bitcoin is. It fosters a sense of confidence in me that not just the ""outsiders"", (like ghana and estonia) are leading the search interest in Ethereum, rather the western nations with more resources and power to influence change, (like Germany, USA, Holland), are the people most interested in Ethereum.

*Update 06/30* this is what I mean, even if the technical aspect is plain wrong in this article, the basic assumption is right - no regulated bank, even outside the EU, will accept what the Ethereum Foundation - *itself being in no way a regulated entity* - is going to do: http://www.coindesk.com/spectre-ethereum-hardfork-worries-anz-banking-group/
---

I am a software engineer and studied computer science, *not* law, *not* economics. Therefore, my assumptions are purely based on my experience I acquired in 10 years of working in the financial industry, I would be more than happy if someone with formal knowledge could disprove me.

I am working at a major securities service provider, we are continuously extending the retail platform for investment product and services. As such, we operate in a highly regulated field, with currently still growing regulatory requirements.
Following the typical ""career path"" of software developers, after about 6 years I went from software development to software architecture, so right now I am responsible for matching business requirements, but more and more also regulatory requirements to technical implementation. So I have a basic knowledge of law and regulations which fit for out industry.
Also, I am responsible for evaluating blockchain solution for our company. As you might know, every bank is evaluating this currently and in 6-12 months a lot of BC or DLT-related projects will go live.

This is my perception of the situation:
90-95% of all projects will be Ethereum- or Hyperledger-based *private* or *consortium* blockchain solutions. They will focus back-office or B2B applications.

To evaluate a technology, we have to make sure it fits several aspects, I just take three of them:

 * security
 * privacy
 * immutability
 
these must be met to a certain degree to allow for the usage of a technology.

In the case of a *private* or *known nodes* blockchain, my answer, even after the DAO incident, it's easy:

 * security: yes, it's secure
 * privacy: depends on implementation
 * immutability: depends on implementation

and the send-Bug? No problem at all, it's a bug, we understand it, we are implementing the chain, so we take care of it (by code checks, by dedicated ""smart send contracts""). So no problem here.

Now, what about the 5-10% in the *public* chain? Most likely, they would like to use Ethereum, because it is the only BC-solution with real smart contracts. These will be necessary for use cases like KYC, Oracles,  Smart Bonds, etc.

Now, the aspects evaluated again:

 * security: yep
 * privacy: really difficult in the public BC, but possible, depends on implementation
 * immutability: ...?

we have a problem here. Up to the DAO incident, we would have evaluated this aspect as ""yep"", because it was said to be and it made sense that no-one can influence all miners which are dependent on the incentive (reward). 

It really doesn't matter if the attacker is a bad guy and if it is just fair to give back the money, even just the soft fork is something like a AML event, which can only be done by regulated entities. 
Whatever this might be, it is surely not a private ... what ... Foundation in Switzerland? Which is also involved in the entity which is bailed-out? It doesn't matter if this Foundation cannot change the protocol itself, it's influence on the miners is already a huge problem (or would *you* succeed in getting money back because your contract failed? Could you even ask those miners?)

To me this means, if there will be some kind of fork, I wouldn't consider Ethereum public BC since I am sure it would fail even the most basic regulatory requirements. 

Ok, once again, I might be totally wrong here and if you know better, please comment. It and I would just be sad if no financial institution in the EU could use Ethereum for retail use cases just because one DAO was bailed out and as a result certain criteria are not met any more. This could be a much greater loss than the 100 mill. for bailing out now.   ",1467062942
3435,ethereum,Now what?,"Disclamer: I had 1k-2k ETH and I have 0 DAO. I am currently 80% in BTC.

Lets say the forks all go through. If I understand it correctly you want all your ETH that you invested in DAO back. Say you get it all back. And then ETH price falls to 0.010. 

Is that a win? Is that what you want?
     

Or do you somehow think forking ETH will help it?


So far the only way I imagine this is: ETH people losing and DAO people gaining back their failed gamble.

Are you lot really believing ETH will somehow gain trust by forking? Do you actually believe that ETH price will rise after you get your DAO back? You will all sell your ETH and run back to BTC as soon you get your lost money back. 

And I think ETH will burn for it. ",1467063815

3438,ethereum,Quick-Fix for the potential Dao Soft-Fork Ddos,"I read some concerned posts by people who believe the softfork introduces a way for an attacker to drain the CPU resources of the miner censoring Dao-balance altering transactions.

This because the transactions still have to be processed and if they are found to alter the dao balance they will be rejected. However the attacker will not pay gas for having the miner do this work.

I have not read any responce of the dev community regarding the feasability of this attack vector, maybe it is not a concern under reallife circumstances. But if it is a concern then a quickfix may be required.

A quickfix for this problem would be that the miner would blacklist the sender address of this dao-balance-altering transaction for 24 hours. 

This way this behaviour will again be contained by the amount of gas required to create a new account.

While not perfect it is probably already enough to make the attack ineffective, because I suspect most miners have a lot of spare CPU power with the current network load. So we will be able to censor the network for long enough to initiate the planned whitehat actions.

This could be futher enhanced if relaying nodes are encouraged to do the same.",1467066289

 - Application: http://ethereum.github.io/remix 
 - Instructions: https://github.com/ethereum/remix/blob/master/README.md 

Remix is basically an attempt to replace our IDE Mix with a more flexible,
modular, lightweight and integratable tool.

Mix has a lot of nice features but is also a stand alone application and there
are already a LOT of good IDEs on the market. Due to its use of C++/Qt,
it requires a lot of build maintenance.

With the current release 0.1 of remix, you can:

 - connect it to geth or eth
 - debug / re-run any transaction geth/eth knows about

Plans for the future include:

 - Make it prettier :)
 - Add source code debugging.
 - Add transaction explorer.
 - Integrate into mist (intercept transactions). 
 - Integrate with browser-solidity and others IDEs.
 - Allow to use Ethereum-js instead of Geth for the backend.

Hope you will enjoy using this new tool!
Feedback, as always, is very welcome!

Amended the amount: it's 344,907 ether, approx 3% or $4m (thanks Gloomy Oak)

ORIGINAL POST

The Dao funds include approximately 3% 'extra' in the form of extraBalance. Since the tokens are fungible and traded, should a HF recover all funds then then those who funded extraBalance can't easily be made whole, and probably couldn't expect to be. Ideas:

1) Return to token holders, meaning ~3% profit. I'm intuitively against this but guessing it's the preferred option.

2) Used to pay bounties to everyone involved in the recovery. Who, how much, slock?!

3) Burn it (wasteful)

4) Grant to the foundation

5) Ethereum smart contract security fund managed by community members (not a dao, named people)

6) Distribute to non dao holders in some way?!

There's a notion of token holders voting but that'd need to be done soon.

What would people prefer and what other ideas are there?

3527,ethereum,Do nothing and move on,"I've been against a fork from the beginning so full disclosure there. But I really think it's time to move on.

TheDAO holders lost a lot of money and a great idea is gone, but Ethereum still has a chance to move on from this.

Everyone keeps mentioning regulators. I've been in the financial industry for 25 years and I am certain regulators will come knocking no matter what the community does here. If the Eth Foundation hasn't reached out to SEC and FINRA for advice here, they should do so. They can help clean this up in a way that satisfies them and keeps them from pursuing further corrective action.

I'd be most worried about the marketing surrounding the crowd sale. More than anything, that is what regulators will probably be concerned with. If the Eth Foundation has clean hands surrounding that, then they should separate themselves from this mess.

Investors have lost money. Eth has been shorted into the ground. Even if theDAO holders get some or all of their Eth back, they will not be made whole. Following a hard fork, I would expect further shorting and lots of Eth being dumped on the market. Similarly, if we do nothing, we can expect the same outcome due to ""the attacker"" dumping their shares.

I'm concerned with the legal liability that may be taken on by the Eth foundation by attempting fixes. They had nothing to do with what happened to theDAO but they are going to great lengths to fix it, which can be seen as ""consciousness of guilt"". They may actually be creating liability for themselves by attempting to fix this.

I know this will get downvoted but man, I wish the Eth Foundation would make a statement on this and be done with it. Let the chips fall, buy Eth on the way down and on the way back up, keep faith in the blockchain and in smart contracts and be done with this mess. ",1467146165
3528,ethereum,Smart contracts - not so smart yet,"Having worked in both IT and Legal fields for quite some time, I am quite surprised by the DAO disaster in Ethereum, and I think the guys responsible for the smart contracts got it quite wrong. I think they have been extremely naive, and as a result a brilliant theoretical idea has become a disaster in the making.

Let me explain in more detail what attributes a good contract consists of (this is not an exhaustive list, of course):

1 - A good contract allows any layperson to understand it. I am not an expert in law history, but there has been a trend to simplify the clauses in legal texts for a long, long time. Complexity, once considered an art, is no longer considered useful. Therefore, for a contract to be good (ahem, smart), it has to be understood by a high-school dropout. This logically leads me to say, that high-level tools that allow writing the contracts (which are essentially code) have to be pretty smart and take care of all the heavy lifting.

2 - A good contract provides for an option to modify it. In my 10+ years of reading the legal contracts I am yet to come across a contract which is immutable by design. One exception is a will, which becomes immutable when the guy actually dies, but even then, it's not that simple. Hey, even the Founding Fathers provided for a possibility to amend the Constitution. This modification ability has to be built into the contracts. Of course, there should be a possibility to choose how such amendments are to be made - by a majority vote, super-majority, or by splitting a one-to-many contract into many one-to-one contracts that have to be approved only by 2 parties.

3 - Majority of the contracts also state what should be done in case of a dispute. And majority of the contracts elect the authority (arbitrage courts, national courts, etc.) that can decide the outcome in grey areas. Of course, such an authority has to be trusted, but there is a reason for allowing for this - because there is a huge potential for fraud, errors and grey area. The authority should have the right to empower a decision - this means the authority will have the right to freeze assets, return assets, and so on. What to do with that sort of power and how to restrict it? It's a complicated question, but it has to be seriously addressed.

In the DAO scenario, because there is no dispute resolution mechanism, the only option possible is the majority vote by the miners and the guys writing the software. This becomes a hugely ineffective process. Think, if you had your TV delivered faulty - would you want to have to call a worldwide referendum to decide the case for you? Of course not!

4 - Software has bugs, contracts have laws and court precedents. Let's say, you have a contract, which states that ""John gives Ann a 1,000 USD and gets a TV in return"". Let's say that Ann then claims, that by ""gets a TV in return"" Ann meant that she simply rents it to John for time being, so 1,000 USD is not the purchase price of the TV, it's merely the cost of a rent. The courts will decide on a case like that, and if there are many cases like that, they can do changes in the legislation. Let's say, they decide, that ""gets a TV in return"" means - the TV becomes property of John. All existing contracts will automatically work under this new precedent or law (in case of civil law countries). This means that the definition (understanding) of the sentence will change, even though the wording itself will stay the same. Some wording in contracts might even become illegal or invalid over time. (In most contracts there is actually a clause, which states that if a particular clause is not valid or illegal, this does not invalidate the whole contract.) 

So, unless there is a possibility to change the definition without changing the contracts, the bugs in contracts won't be fixed. But if you allow the definitions to be changed, then a ""bad operator"" can change the contracts to its own advantage, or introduce further bugs. It's also a problem that has to be addressed.

5 - Assignment clauses. The assigment or a cession is pretty standard for most contracts as well. The parties to the contract usually agree, that they can replace themselves with another party under particular conditions. It's possible to state, what is needed to do such an assignment, and it does not have to be symmetrical. Eg., a buyer can change to another buyer without the seller's approval, but a seller needs to seek an approval of the buyer. In any case, such a mechanism has be incorporated into the contracts.

6 - Contract templates. If you want to buy a real estate in California, the realtor will give you a template contract that he filled out. The realtor is not a lawyer, but he knows, that this contract covers 99% of issues that can come up in the process of buying a house. The template is updated by the lawyers (aka programmers) from time to time, but the template allows any layment to enter the contract without having expert legal (programming) knowledge. 

Not to bore everyone, these are just a few things that smart contracts have to be aware of. 

Law and contracts are a complicated matter and lawyers have been advancing their theoretical base for a long, long time. Ignoring all that body of knowledge of the legal profession in what makes a good or bad contract is a huge mistake. There is a potential to make digital contracts a reality, but it seems that without onboarding legal experts this will be a futile exercise.",1467146296

3534,ethereum,The soft fork vulnerability shows that we must take protocol changes seriously,"The Ethereum protocol is a precision machine, assembled over the course of more than a year by some of the smartest people I've had the pleasure of meeting. It balances dozens of competing design goals against a wide range of possible attacks and usecases, and so far has juggled it all admirably. But, like all precision machines, we must make any changes to it with the utmost care.

Imagine it as a literal machine, making widgets in a factory. Even the smallest change to a single part-- shorting a lever by a quarter inch, or using copper instead of steel-- may at best lead to inferior widgets, and at worst could make the whole thing catch fire. 

With the soft fork, we tried the smallest of tweaks on one of the smallest parts. We didn't even touch the core protocol, just the clients' mining strategy. And yet, this quarter-inch difference was enough that, if it were released, it could have taken down the network's transaction processing capabilities for as long as the change was active. If we understand that the Ethereum protocol is a precision machine, then this shouldn't surprise us, but it should inspire us to caution.

While the experts agree that hard forks are in some ways more safe than soft forks, they are certainly not _completely_ safe. Any imprecision in the fork specification, or any difference between client implementations, could lead to an unplanned chain split. Any exchange, retailer, or partially-centralized dapp which doesn't update in time will be exposed to a variety of attacks. And of course there are the ""unknown unknowns"" that are always present when messing with a complex, precision system: we might find a seemingly innocuous change breaks something completely unexpected.

None of this is to say that we cannot or even should not do a hard fork. Many good arguments have been raised by smart people on both sides. But if we choose to do it, let's do it with open eyes, and realize what we're doing: choosing to accept systemic risk on behalf of all Ethereum users.",1467148202

3564,ethereum,Ethereum - Risky Dao Referendum?,"Recent polls, stickied throughout the community, have shown the soft-fork well ahead, this seems to have given many a false sense that 'all is well', when in-fact were far from. Unaccounted for in these polls is the all-important 'vote' of big money &amp; special interests who may have enough money on the line, to lose or gain, to make 'pushing' the vote to result in an outcome of their choosing worthwhile.  

This is the first vote of it's kind in crypto-history, never before has there been so much $ on the line resting on a votes outcome. The huge monetary incentive, combined with the recent miner downsizing, are attributing ingredients to what I believe is a far riskier vote then the  community, at whole, seems to think.

Popular mining pools [Minergate](https://minergate.co) and [Ethermine](https://ethermine.org), have announced voting mechanisms in place for the referendum, great I thought, until reading this part, I quote from [ethermine](https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/7796/dao-soft-fork-voting-on-ethpool-ethermine); ""The voting process will end a few days before the freeze period of the Child-DAO"". In-the-know Ethereum people have related to my concerns on the matter; in the case something was to go wrong with the vote these pools aren't leaving us anywhere near enough time to come up with a solution.

So, what can we do?

Individually, the best thing you can do is to cast your vote. Collectively, we need to to see this issue discussed more as many seem clueless to the danger. Best case scenario, the community comes together and launches a ""call to arms"", of sorts, in which we encourage all(regardless of computer strength) to participate in the coming miner vote. Only through a large influx of community participation in the miner referendum can rest assured an outcome favored by the consensus being reached. 

If we fail this biggest of tests, as much as I hate to say it - I personally don't see Ethereum ever recovering (this is coming from a pre-release Ethereum fanboy of the highest calibre). On the other hand, if the community collectively comes together and the consensus wins the day, I see the brightest of futures ahead. The kind of victory I can see taking us to the stars :)

It isn't possible to reliably do what needs to be done to implement a hard fork in the time remaining before the hacker can withdraw his ether, mix it, trade it and exit. 

So far, we do not even know what approach to development the hard fork plans to take, let alone have we seen any proposed code.  Moreover, to change the rules of the chain, to invalidate existing on-chain accounts' balances, to create new accounts, to add ether to those new accounts and move funds into new contracts and write new code for those contracts that work properly to allow Dao tokens to be sent to them in exchange for ether redemption, and to update all wallet software on all platforms and to update all mining scripts to see those changes as valid is something that will take way too long to develop and way too long to test and way too long to deploy. Such code would need to be tested for security flaws extensively.  And there's certainly no time for that.

Anyone who takes a few minutes to think about this (and who has any software development and deployment experience on a large scale system) will realize this is an inescapable fact of reality.

The hacker has won. 

And so has immutability, although not because anybody in the ethereum community spoke up for the principle of immutability.  No. Immutability won because of the clumsiness, sloppiness and hubris of the ethereum community that presumed it could censor transactions, write reliable, secure code in a week and ignore every warning that led up to this debacle.

3570,ethereum,How I could be convinced to support a Hard Fork,"Ethereum promised to ""run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference."" There was no asterisk there, but I inferred subtext: as we fix bugs and add features to Ethereum, we will push upgrades that could alter state or blocks. Effectively, that's a kind of interference or censorship, but one we want. Ethereum is still young. There be dragons.

If the DAO hard fork were addressing a bug in the EVM, then I expect resistance would have been low. There was no EVM bug identified. I could buy into a well-crafted argument that there was a flaw in Solidity, such that the language caused the bug in The DAO, rather than the author. Some people have explored this possibility, but I'm not yet convinced about a specific flaw.

There will always be beta contracts, no matter how stable Ethereum becomes. Unless we require an Ethereum platform change as part of new hard forks, then there always looms the (social) expectation that we might HF to bugfix a sufficiently huge contract. That is a reason I'm currently against the HF.

But I could be a strong supporter of the Hard Fork if it comes with an Ethereum platform change. Maybe function re-entrance should be disallowed in Solidity without an explicit keyword to enable it? I haven't done enough research to propose the ""right"" flaw to fix, or its solution. But I'm enough of a technologist to recognize it when I see it. If the Foundation effectively identifies a specific problem and solution with Ethereum (probably Solidity), as part of a campaign to HF, I would become a supporter.",1467162811

3595,ethereum,How will the Network Decide If The Hard Fork Has Consensus?,"With a soft fork it's very clear that the version with the most mining power carries the day. The block gas limit voting feature for the current, vulnerable soft fork is very clever, because it allows all the nodes to see if the fork has support from the miners, and if so causes them all to follow along. It avoids a long messy period of coming to consensus, where people who don't take the fork are mining blocks that their peers aren't accepting and dealing with constant reorgs.

How would this work for a hard fork? In a hard fork, we can't look at the total hash power for and against and agree who would win in an actual fight. If we actually played the game all the way out, answering the ""which is the real Ethereum"" question would involve a lot of decisions made by exchanges, individual users, semi-centralized Dapp operators, and potentially trademark courts if anyone actually owns a trademark on the ""Ethereum"" name. The result of such a situation is hard to foresee, especially in code. So Ethereum implementations won't be able to look on the chain and see whether the hard fork has enough support before actually taking it.

In light of that, is there going to be some sort of formal poll or survey of the community? Something to illustrate to whoever's backing the less real fork that they are in fact backing the less real fork, before the actual fork?",1467176230
3596,ethereum,Why the Counterparty Launch is irrelevant,"http://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-to-gain-ethereums-functionality-through-counterparty-launch-by-autumn

In short, after the recent price drop due to the joint factors of the ongoing DAO issues, and the launch of Counterparty coming up very shortly, it is worth remembering why Etheruem is still in a much stronger position than Bitcoin going into the future. 

Firstly, the confirmation time is going to seriously hamper smart contracts built on Bitcoin. 10 minutes is not acceptable, and it is only to get worse.

Secondly, the halving is significant, because while Bitcoin is on a proof of work mining model, mining suddenly becomes far less profitable if the price of bitcoin fails to rise sufficiently. It is hard to say if this will occur or not, but if it does fail to rise, mining will decline, and despite recent efforts to increase the efficiency of the network, Bitcoin will suffer greater centralization, longer confirmation times, and greater network instability. 

It could be argued that this will have a compounding effect to the detriment of the bitcoin network, ultimately resulting in it's demise. Yes this is speculative, but with this as a possible outcome, I know which network I'm putting my money and smart contracts in. 

However, Ethereum, in order to remain competitive, should set itself apart and advance the transition to proof of stake. At present, Ethereum presents no clear features over counterparty, other than the network issues raised earlier. If the underlying network of the Ethereum smart contract framework were to transition to a far superior mining protocol, it would solidify Ether's place at the top of the smart-contract food chain. Let's get this DAO thing sorted, and move on to securing the reign of Ethereum.

I'm NOT a developer. I only understand cryptocurrencies on a superficial level, Ethereum included.

I work at a boutique investment bank in SF and have viewed eth, since it's inception, as a speculative investment. I view Bitcoin the same way. It's a lottery ticket. Feel free to hate on me, but at the end of the day people like me are buying, holding, and supporting the price level and price increases we've seen.

I don't know much about the tech but I DO know more than most of you about investing. On the whole ""forking"" to save the DAO folks. This is perhaps the dumbest thing I've seen come out of crypto-land since I initially dove in to your world. And there have been lots of dumb things. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? Those lost funds have NOTHING TO DO with the core platform, correct? It's a third party thing, correct? Why on earth would you change anything about the platform in order to bail out a screw-up by some third party? Sure, fix underlying security issues but for the love of all that is holy, don't bail out a crappy investment.

What you've built here is a network that is worth over a billion dollars. BILLION. For f's sake your tech is being used by MICROSOFT among other Fortune 500 companies. DON'T SCREW THIS. I feel bad that some lost money on the DAO but guess what -- THAT'S LIFE FOLKS!! &lt;--is there a way to triple caps that last sentence to get my point across? You bail out a bad investment, you lose credibility IMMEDIATELY as a trustable platform.

You aren't a government. You aren't a parent. You aren't friends. You aren't a family. You aren't a team. You aren't ANY OF THAT. You know what you are? You are a cold, hard, emotionless, robotic, efficient, steely, inhuman, programmable, ruthlessly consistent, network that takes inputs and produces outputs with unforgiving speed and accuracy better than any other computing or payment network in existence. No time for emotion here. That's how you win this game. That's how you become an internet for value, for money, for computing. Stop bitching and do what it takes to win. Otherwise, good riddance.

3600,ethereum,Hard fork leading to 2 distinct chains: how to benefit from it.,"Let's assume the hard fork is proposed before July 14th:
The white hat DAO will follow the hard fork, that's already 14 percent of the ETH existing. 
Let's assume some exchange and some miners will follow the hard fork as well.
The hard fork is different from the soft fork, because users (miners, holders, markets, etc) can chose to follow it or not, or both (by loading 2 distinct blockchains).

Let's assume we end up in mid July with 2 separate blockchains: ""1 for DTH and 1 for immutability purists"" (I over simplify for the sake of argumentation), with 2 distinct financial valuation...

3629,ethereum,Why I switch to be a pro forker,"I explained the latest developments for a friend, and we had a good laugh discussing the softfork and the possibility of DDOSing. Not that it was funny really, but you have to express your feelings someway. At that point, my friend commented that this technology doesn't seem to be very mature yet. That hurt a little, as I have quite a lot of emotional investment in Ethereum.

To an outsider, it is just what it looks like. So I started to think, maybe I should swallow my pride, and reset my point of view? The DAO was definitely premature, and it was unfortunate it got to grow as big as it did. What is really unfortunate now, is that a high proportion of developers (foundation and client developers) are very busy because of the soft and hard fork assessments. But that can't be helped.

To move on to a more mature technology, I look forward to ways that will make contracts more robust. There has already been some interesting discussions, and I am sure there is a lot of research out there ready to be adopted. The improved robustness has been needed all the time, but it wasn't until now everyone understand it.

Another area that will surely be looked into, is the issue of immutability and censorship resistance. There is the year old blog from Vitalik about this, and I look forward to developments in this area.

So why then do I support a hardfork now? It is because of my changed point of view. If the technology is considered as not mature, then patches like these are more acceptable. Eventually, I hope the improved contract robustness is accompanied by a matching hardening from censorship. It is going to be needed to regain trust from all parties.

We were led to believe that this is going to be consensus.  People would vote on the soft fork. The pools would act in accordance with the vote which was in favor of the soft fork.

Now we have a potential exploit found in the soft fork. So the pools decided to cancel the soft fork. (This is ok in theory, not in how it was actually done.)

Problem is, this is a POSSIBLE area for someone to collude. They could easily go and short ETH and DAO knowing that the cancelled soft fork would cause more worry about the future of ETH and DAO.

I'm glad we didn't soft fork and get exploited by a hacker. However I'm not happy with how it was handled.  We opened ourselves up to being exploited from the inside.  

I'm not saying anyone did act maliciously and short ETH or DAO. I don't know. 

I don't like the fact that a few people have fore knowledge about changes that can easily affect the price of ETH and DAO. It makes me want to vote against ANY forks now.  I'm beginning to understand the other side of the argument against the forks.",1467202936

But I also hate the idea of permanently scarring the protocol with interference directly into the state of the blockchain, as well as the moral hazard of bailing out the reckless investors who caused this mess in the first place.

Perhaps a middle path that could reach consensus, is a hard fork to intervene in the DAO contracts and return some, but not all, of the funds. The remainder that are not returned could be burned instead, decreasing total supply and acting as a repayment to the rest of the Ethereum ecosystem for the damage the DAO has caused to Ethereum's reputation and the permanent damage to the protocol.

The 70% recovery that was expected from the soft fork until it turned out to be unviable seems like a good number to me, which would mean burning the other 30% as a ""hard fork fee"". 

The way to deal with this from a legal perspective to cover the foundation and other exposed developers would be to both release a client with a 100% return hard fork, alongside a client with a 30% haircut hard fork, and then let the community adopt whichever it can reach consensus on adopting.

Edit: obviously the numbers here are purely suggestions and could be anything, like 50%, 90% or anything else. If a haircut is deemed the right solution the process of reaching consensus would be for the community to debate the exact amount until we arrive at one that the vast majority is fine with.",1467207791

The subjectivity does not matter, but how convincing the arguments are.

If there's enough argumentation in favor of not forking, we'll see the wheels turning again, and many noobish cocksuckers that lost money raging and fighting each other will try to enforce the public opinion that rationalizes the pro-fork fuckup arguments.

3660,ethereum,Fork == Bailout,"I am new to Ethereum, but want to ask this question and present this argument to the community:

It seems to me that trying to return money to the victims of the DAO hack significantly undermines Ethereum as a platform.

Isn't one of the major points of distributed trust the idea that you can't win by influencing a small group of people?   What if a government puts pressure on Vitalik and others to do another fork with to fight something that is deemed a crime?  What if a criminal organization wants a fork to help it win against a rival?

Secondly, let's consider stake.  If proof of stake makes any sense at all, it would seem that letting the attacker keep his/her well-earned stake in the Ethereum's success is a good thing.  Whoever it was is a valuable friend to the Ethereum community, not an enemy. 

All those whose ignorance about security and general gullibility led them to lose money... well, they are not the people we *want* to have stake, since they have poor judgment.  Of course that is an exaggeration, but if smart contracts are the law it's reality. 

When the mainstream financial system was bailed out in 2008 it was because the honchos running the show didn't like certain prices.  Rather than accept price as information, they wished to use their power to change prices.  To do so they had to bail out major banks and insurance companies, and reward a lot of foolish decisions and sloppy risk taking.  This is possible to some extent in a Fiat system.

But cryptocurrencies do not come with a military... As a result they need to be justly governed and earn their credibility through principled governance. If done well this is the ultimate form of legitimacy, and something we should all be very proud that Ethereum might achieve if we can avoid things like politically-motivated forks.

If the smart contract functioned properly (even if the proper behavior wasn't intended) then the results should stand.  Let us all become smarter and avoid this in the future.  Let us all buy up some extra ether if the price is down a bit. 

There are so many ways to improve the ecosystem after this kind of thing, and a fork reduces (or completely removes) all the good incentives.

Sure, much of the Ether lost was from early adopters and enthusiasts who might be pretty bummed out about it.  I'm sure the Federal Reserve governors felt the same way about their cronies who ran banks that were about to fail due to poor risk assessment decisions. But sometimes the principle matters more than a particular outcome. 

If we Fork whenever there is a subjectively undesirable transfer of wealth, then it becomes completely impossible for Ethereum to to be trusted for anything important. 

Let us not forget that what makes Ethereum interesting is that the code is the law.  The minute we open the door to ""wise elders"" doing ""what is right"" we have a political group with all the downsides... most notably a power structure that claims the moral wisdom and righteousness to play God, when the design of Ethereum is supposed to prevent that!

If you execute the placeWager() function and include between 0 and 256 finney, you could be the one to push the balance of the contract over the critical value and receive a 5 ether prize. 

You can interact with it through the mist browser with these parameters: 

[EDIT]

I have a new version of the game up. It's much better. More random, and the system will show you the address of the last winner if you watch the contract. Also I have verified the contract with the source code. 

[Ether Penny Slots](https://etherchain.org/account/0x930dcb225ff8C8eA9d3dCCd980f04316853A9Eb6#code)

One important thing to note is that the payout and wagers are smaller. Between 1 and 50 finney per wager, you get one entry per finney. So you have to do multiple 50 finney wagers over several transactions if you wish to put in a bunch of entries. This should make it more fun because mining is also a factor. And the jackpot payout is 500 finney now, with a 601 pot limit to reach before jackpot payout. so 100 goes to the hot wallet, and 500 to the winner. 1 finney per win will stay in the contract.

3680,ethereum,Risks/Gains and What May Happen If we Fork / Don't Fork,"I am into ethereum since last April. To be honest I was fascinated by the vision behind ethereum, and I am still is. But as a professional software developer I always had reservations about the capabilities of solidity and The Ethereum VM. Now we see that writing smart contracts does not only require knowledge of solidity but also how Ethereum VM works. In other words solidity is not a high level language with full abstraction capabilities.

Also as a side note I possess only a minimal amount of eth gained through mining and I don't hold any DAO coins.

My opinions on hardfork  are below, I will try to state as minimal political thoughts as possible about community, democracy and ethics etc. I will try to introduce a technical perspective within my knowledge.

1) It is not technically desirable to solve a DApp problem by changing the protocol due to separation of concerns principle. You may think that we have to be practical here and don't think too much about principles. But principles are not luxuries in normal times but also guides in times of crises.

2) Implementing a hard fork within the timeframe we have is very risky. Look at the past: the DAO had a critical bug that no one realized till exploited, the soft fork has a critical bug that no one realized till it was released. Now most people are eager for a hard fork and they seem very confident on its success. I am not so confident. This is a wicked problem. ""Every solution is a candidate for a new problem"". It is naive to think of hard fork as a silver bullet. If we believe the attacker's intentions is to destroy ethereum he/she will do anything to sabotage a hard fork.

3) If the hard fork causes a significant bug it would be a disaster and may be the end of ethereum. 

4) There will be more buggy contracts. I can assure you on that. There is nothing as a completely safe contract in scales of complexity like this. If we hard fork now we are accepting the fact that we will hard fork every time a big amount is lost in a shitty contract. I am not saying this is completely a bad thing, in fact it may be a safety mechanism when code fails. But I think everybody should accept that frequent hard forks will diminish the productivity of ethereum

5) If we fork and it succeeds it will probably end this mess. I don't think anybody with good intentions will be intimidated by the fact that the attacker's funds are confiscated. It may even deter attackers to some extend.

6) If we do not fork there will be an actor within the framework with bad intentions. This is not the end of the world. PoS or any other subsystem in ethereum must be able cope with a bad actor having %5 of funds. In fact a known bad actor - a Chaos Monkey - will force us to improve the reliability of Ethereum, and will keep us on our toes. There will always be bad actors. I don't believe in the argument that ""We can't live with the attacker holding %5 of funds"". Instead the motto should be ""We will have to learn living with bad actors""

7) If we do not fork many people will lose their savings and most of those people are -from my understanding- are important for eco-system. This may have serious bad affects. Also losing the money which is supposed to be funding killer DApps may set back ethereum for a considerable time 

My point is that hard fork or not we will sustain some more damage. It is important to know the risks and act logically instead of emotional ""let's get on with it"" impulse. It seems most of the devs and community is under immerse pressure but we have to listen to each other, try to understand pros/cons of a hard fork, and stop trying to persuade others with pragmatic approches.

3681,ethereum,My real estate transaction had a Hard Fork clause,"I had to sign mountains of papers to sell my house this week.  One of them was a ""do over"" clause, that says in the event of a paperwork error, I agree to work with all parties involved to make it right.  In other words, nobody can get a free house due to human error.

I have gone back and forth on the hard fork question, but I am finally settling in favor of it, because this is how things work in the real world.  Real estate has a hard fork clause because it makes sense. No institutions will take any system seriously unless catastrophic human error can be corrected.

Having said that, I recognize the slippery slope argument, and it is very real and concerning.  I think this needs to be a wake up call to developers that the contracts will need to have emergency escape clauses built in.  The network cannot rely on hard forks in the future; the contracts will have to deal with escape clauses in their own.",1467227057

3683,ethereum,Poloniex ColdWallet (9.3% of all ETH) just got drained by an attack!,"**I LIED**. 

BUT what if it did?

If there’s anything this DAO attack has made clear, it’s that the ethereum community must be much more proactive in pointing out security concerns within the network. We can’t let ourselves fall victim to bystander apathy and assume that someone else is taking care of everything.


With that in mind, there have been several posts now about the size of Poloniex’s wallet. This single account currently holds ~ 9.3% of all eth (https://etherscan.io/accounts). If an attacker was able to figure out how to drain this single account it would be an absolute disaster for entire ecosystem. 


I’ve searched their website &amp; emailed them for info regarding the security measures they have in place. No response yet, and the only thing I can find on the website is a brief note saying that the “Majority of customer funds kept in cold storage” &amp; the “Entire exchange continually audited and inspected for unusual activity”. Is the ethereum community really comfortable with this? Based on past posts going nowhere (&amp; getting downvoted) it seems that we are, but I want to plead one more time for all of us to make some noise about this. 

Why can’t Poloniex spread this out to multiple wallets so there’s not a single point of failure? Where are the security audits? Who is auditing? Are we just trusting that what they call a ""ColdWallet"" is really that? Do the ethereum devs or foundation have an opinion? Etc., etc.


I’d also like to start a conversation about industry best practices in the ethereum network. Shouldn’t we request that wallets never contain more than x% of the total eth supply? Too Big to Fail is a real thing that we should try very hard to avoid. What about hardcoding wallet size limits into the protocol to forever avoid To Big Too Fail scenarios? I’m a goddamn carpenter so my ideas might not make any sense at the technical level, but this seems like a big concern that we should all be talking about. Just my 2 cents! At the very least if you share my concerns reach out to Poloniex like I did, https://poloniex.com/contact

3692,ethereum,Ethereum with a Constitution and Legislative Initiatives can become a true Democracy. While Bitcoin still lingers in a Plutocratic Civil War,"**For Transparency, System Robustness and Investor Confidence, we need an Ethereum Constitution**

**a)  with clear rules when hard forks are justified**

**b) with a system of Legislative Initiatives for all other cases**

Last week, I called for [Governance Rules for Ethereum]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4pgf03/fork_call_for_ethereum_governance_rules/) to provide a *framework for when to FORK*. 
In the subsequent discussion, [Vitalik]( https://www.reddit.com/user/vbuterin/) asked me to provide examples of what I had in mind.
I told him I would structure my thoughts and get back, which I do herewith.

**Let’s use real-world experience to shape the Ethereum Democracy.**

Many smart thinkers, from Aristoteles to the fathers of our modern constitutions,  have been pondering  the best, most efficient and most just ways how to establish social consensus and how to design governance rules. 
These rules have been “field tested” in very many settings, and a couple of “best-practice” rules have emerged. I suggest borrowing from these concepts when we establish the governance rules for Ethereum.

**Law**

In Ethereum, the protocol is the law. It is commonly accepted that the law needs to play four roles:

* Protection of the actors from harm
* Ensure a common good
* Settlement of arguments and disputes regarding finite resources
* Persuasion of the actors to behave in a “good” way

In my opinion, the Ethereum protocol fulfills these points. However, there are implications: 

* As our world is not static, it must be possible to update the law, and create new law. ==&gt; **Legislative**

* The law must be applied. ==&gt; **Executive**

* If actors don’t agree, there must be ways to judge who is right or wrong. ==&gt; **Judicative**

History shows that the separation of the three powers, Legislative, Executive and Judicative, is crucial for the robustness and long-term success of a system. I consider this system of checks and balances as given in the context of Ethereum.

Actually, the roles of the Executive and Judicative are rather unproblematic: 

* The **miners are the Executive**. They decide if they want to apply the law or not (note that I don’t concur with the opinion promoted by some members of the community that miners are “voters”, miners don’t vote, they implement law.)

* The role of the **Judicative is inherent in the EVM** – this is one of the big advantages of the digital world where code is processed

This leaves us with the Legislative; a role that is currently assumed by the Ethereum Foundation and its development team, as well as other developer teams who come up with new features and improvements of the protocol functionality.

The creation of new or the adjustment of existing “Ethereum Law” is inherently  more problematic, as we currently see in the case of THE DAO fork. It actually raises many questions about what changes are justified under which circumstances.

**To come up with answers how to manage the process of legislation, I urge the community to consider historic lessons learned**.

Successful democracies like Switzerland follow two principles:

a)	 A constitution states general principles that act as guidelines in the creation of law, and must be respected by the Legislative

b)	Voters have the optionality of initiatives to reject laws proposed by the legislative body, or to force the legislative body to come up with a desired change in law. To do so and to avoid that the whole process gets jammed, an initiative needs to gather a certain quorum of voters to be considered.


Such a system is rather easy to implement in the digital context of Ethereum.

My suggestion is to keep the Constitution very simple (aspects that do not concern legislation may be added, but are out of scope of this discussion). It would contain a universal guideline of cases where forks are justified, and the possibility of a legislative initiative (FORK proposal from the community).

**The Ethereum Constitution could look like this:**

* New features (e.g., CASPER) justify hard forks

* Bugs on the protocol level justify hard forks

* Serious bugs on Solidity level justify hard forks

* All other changes need to be suggested via legislative initiative. Such a legislative initiative becomes valid if a certain quorum of all ETH holders approves it within a given timeframe. (The level of the quorum and the duration of the timeframe will need to be defined in a constituent vote of the community)

* All users of Ethereum are required to vote on the fork by installing the new version, or keeping the old one

* Soft forks are not allowed, as they violate the principle of separation of powers outlined above

In the case of the DAO attack, the supporters of a hard fork would need to convince a big enough portion of the ETH shareholders that the fork is justified. If they reach the necessary quorum, the hard fork is prepared and voted upon by the users. 

Given the capabilities of Ethereum, it will be easy to come up with a mechanism where initiatives can be formulated, the support for it counted, and a successful initiative submitted to the Legislators.

Such a constitution will **create transparency about the legislative process in Ethereum**. It will **remove insecurity** of both the developer community and investors about how Ethereum deals with bugs, new features, or attacks. Finally, it will help making **Ethereum a robust, efficient Democracy – in stark contrast to the plutocratic civil war of Bitcoin**.

I have the following idea to avoid HF and propose the attacker a last offer to get away with something in exchange for his private keys of the dark dao and the infiltrated key in the white hat dao. If he does not take it then HF.

This is the proposal:

1. The community decides on the ""bounty"" sum, lets say $10,000 or what ever.
2. A trusted Ethereum dev opens a proposal thru bitrated.com and put's in an equivalent amount of BTC in the Multisig wallet. 
3. A reputable arbitrator is chosen, let's say Coblee (Litecoin creator). We need someone with a good reputation so the attacker has some confidence that the funds will be released to him if he turns out the private keys as agreed.
4. If attacker is interested. He opens account on bitrated and proves that he owns the Dark Dao private keys and the key in white hat child dao by signing a message with his bitrated username with the keys. This way we will know that he has the keys.
5. The dev approves his BTC address.
6. Attacker gives private keys.
7. The bounty released to him.
8. NO HF necessary.

Now the choices are simple: It's either take the ""bounty"", give us the private keys and spare from us the HF. Or force a HF on everyone and get away with a guaranteed 0. If he's after the money and cares even a bit about the network he might go for it.

p.s. I already had a thread about a similar idea
https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4pd4nw/4th_option_to_the_dao_mess_would_you_give_1_to/

but people were against giving a big sum (I also agree to that). Plus, there  seemed to be no way to pull this until the child DAO got out of freeze. But with above bitrated.com method it's possible to do now. 

If he gives the keys BEFORE the unfreeze period ends, Does it enough to avoid a HF?

3736,ethereum,"This time, let's do it right","Instead of rushing to dump 150 million dollars into the largest bug-bounty ever, then rushing to vote in a phenomenal denial of service, and then rushing to vote it out again... We are sitting on the precipice of another potentially uncomfortable situation, with consequences that now will effect not just 15% of Ethereum, but 100%

So this time, lets not make some of the same mistakes.

1.  Lets have the entire decision, the specific fork proposal, laid out for public inspection, well in advance.

2.  In addition to the potentially self-serving opinions of devs and insiders (no offence, but we listened to you last few times, and it got us here, the point is to do it differently this time), lets acquire expert opinions, in writing, from disinterested experts who are qualified to deliver them, and ideally who will indemnify us against their error or oversight.

3. This is not free.  This is a problem from theDAO, so I nominate the cost to be borne by the ether held in theDAO, costs to be born pro-rata by DAO token holders, as of today (take that, hacker!) 

4.  These opinions should not only cover the cyber-security exposures and exploit potential of the code, but a legal opinion of the litigation exposure to miners, exchanges, investors, and others, should they proceed with one side of the fork, or the other.  Obviously, these need to be issued in consideration of the jurisdictions in which miners operate, and in the jurisdictions of the DAO token holders, whose interests might be affected by a fork.

5.  Until we see this in relation to a proposed action, we should agree anyone advocating that course of action is clearly afflicted with a learning disability. Or a troll.

3738,ethereum,Ballpark Stopping Power of The DAO Attacker,"Just some quick thoughts on a potential outcome of this great debate. I am not an expert, my math could be off, take this with a grain of salt, etc.

Let's assume a world where no soft/hard fork goes through and The DAO's attacker gets to keep [all Ether in The Dark DAO](http://etherscan.io/address/0x304a554a310C7e546dfe434669C62820b7D83490). The attacker wants to (1) maximize profit and (2) minimize the risk of getting caught.

Selling the Ether on an exchange would likely violate (2) as doing so leaves an electronic breadcrumb trail of blockchain data, IP addresses and potential ties to real-world identities due to the KYC/AML compliance of major exchanges.

A better approach to achieve (1) without jeopardizing (2) is to short Ether and use the stolen funds to disrupt the network, thus tanking the price, profiting, and maintaining a buffer of plausible deniability. This can be accomplished by spamming Ethereum with junk transactions so normal users can't use the network. So, how many transactions can the attacker generate? 




A transaction requires at least `20185 Gas`, the average price of gas is ~`0.000000022584213073 Ether/Gas` ([Etherscan](http://etherscan.io/charts/gasprice)). The cost of a *single* transaction:

	 20185 Gas * (0.000000022584213073 Ether/Gas) = 0.000455862340878505 Ether/TX


The attacker has `3,641,694 Ether` in The Dark DAO. The number of transactions this buys:

    3,641,694 Ether / (0.000455862340878505 Ether/TX) =~ 7.98 × 10^9 TXs

[Ethereum capped out on Olympic at](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/1782/how-should-we-benchmark-transaction-per-sec/1799#1799) ~`25 TX/sec`. So, if the attacker can generate ~`7.98 × 10^9 TXs` transactions, how long can he/she keep the network at capacity? 

    7.98 × 10^9 TXs / (25 TX/sec) / (60 sec/min) / (60 min/hr) / (24 hr/day) / (365 day/year) =~ 10.13 years 


Yikes! `3,541,694 Ether` buys `10.13 years` of execution maxed at `25 TX/sec`. Of course, **this estimate requires a bunch of factors to remain constant, which may not be practical**. I have limited knowledge of how the EVM operates under stressful conditions (i.e. please correct me on anything). 

Regardless of the exact numbers, I'd think it's fair to say that burning `3,541,694 Ether` on gas fees could disrupt business-as-usual on Ethereum for a solid chunk of time. Placing a large short before the DoS attack would be trivial.

Here's all this entered on WolframAlpha in case anyone wants to mess around with the numbers:

http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(3641694+%2F+(0.000000022584213073+*+20185))+%2F+25+%2F+60+%2F+60+%2F+24+%2F+365

Final question: is The DAO a heist or is it an assassination?

3745,ethereum,Shower thought: How to stop Ethereum Community tearing itself apart,"I'm not in favour of a hard fork for moral hazard reasons. But I can see that any course of action (or lack of action) will have negative consequences. So I'm putting my pragmatic hat on here, my idea isn't 'correct' from a lot of perspectives, which I acknowledge up-front.

Letting the attacker walk off with 3.6m ETH or maybe more will probably de-stabilize the price for quite a while. A lot of people say that shouldn't matter, and perhaps they are right.

But in the meantime you've got dispirited developers, many of whom have just lost life-changing money (yes, I agree, they should have been more careful, but that's beside the point for this thought-experiment). As well as a lot of early adopters who have an almost religious fervour for Ethereum who are now sad pandas.

But assuming that the goal is to put a smile back on everyone's face, and to 'move forward', my idea is this:

* Hard fork.
* Roll back the attempted splits.
* Divide everyone's ETH into 2 piles. The first 1,000 ETH from each account go into Pile A. Any remainder goes into Pile B.
* Create a 100,000 ETH bug bounty pool for the attacker, paid pro-rata out of Pile B.
* Pay out Pile A immediately.
* Put the remainder of Pile B into a contract that will pay out at the rate of 1% a week for the next 100 weeks. Pay the attacker at the same rate (i.e., he/she gets 1,000 ETH a week for 100 weeks).

All of these numbers were just plucked out of the air and could be  tuned. But the basic idea is:

* You give everyone some funds up-front.
* You make everyone almost whole, eventually (you make small-enough investors whole straight away).
* You don't flood the market with ETH on Day 1 after the fork.
* You probably don't crash the price (or you crash it less).
* You make bigger token holders pay more for the bug bounty (small-enough investors pay nothing).
* You give the attacker maybe less reason to remain adversarial.

Drawbacks:

* Such a contract is obviously going to be more complex than a simple split reversal, and more prone to error.
* It's not going to prevent a network split at least in the short-term (but then, apart from doing nothing, nothing is).
* Not everyone will like the idea of rewarding the attacker for what is essentially racketeering.
* It may not stop the attacker.
* It's still basically fiddling with a private contract largely to benefit the privileged at a cost to the hoi-polloi.

3770,ethereum,Provably Destroy the DAO ether,"The current HF proposal has some major drawbacks that could destroy Ethereum's credibility and send the price into a nosedive:

* Returning the DAO Ether to investors will be seen as a bailout, making us no better than the banks.
* It reeks of conflict of interest with developers acknowledged as major DAO stakeholders.
* It sets a precedent and creates the expectation that future losses should also be reimbursed.

The most valid argument for a HF is that it protects future Proof of Stake against a large malicious actor. 

**I propose a hard fork that provably destroys the DAO Ether instead of reimbursing it.** 

The benefits of such a HF are:

* PoS is not jeopardized.
* It is a repeatable precedent that does not create the expectation of future bailouts.
* Destroying 11M ether will increase the value of the remaining supply.

In summary, this solution:

* offers a clean resolution for future, similar events.
* provides incentive for deep testing before investing in similar ventures.
* preserves Ethereum’s integrity (code=law) without rewarding an attacker. 
* could send the price skyrocketing.

It was magic.. comparing our current situation with the development of Bitcoin from 2010 to 2013 was absolutely mind-blowing. I had seen it before but seeing it again put so many things into perspective.  

As a miner it was particularly interesting to see again how much risk early Bitcoin miners took on but not just the miners: Karpeles, Shrem, Ulbricht took on huge risks for the ecosystem. Being innovative means you have to have a high tolerance for risks. It's simply what it takes. It's very unfortunate that some of the most innovative people went straight to prison. Do some of them deserve to be there? Perhaps. Only because it is a virtual realm doesn't mean our laws don't apply here but does it anger me anyway? It does. 

I can only hope that our own ETH entrepreneurs will learn a thing or two from what happened there and prepare themselves for whatever can and will happen. Imagine the worst case, then go one step further and prepare for that outcome. I'd hate to see someone of our own ""family"" go to prison for being innovative. Make sure you're getting licensed, make sure to get good lawyers and do whatever it takes to stay compliant. There is no need to rush things like early Bitcoin innovators did. 

The DAO experiment and MtGox should be a lesson to every innovator out there to not rush things. It's just not worth it!

3795,ethereum,"Hard fork, cryptocurrency, ether as a token: Let's watch this again from a step back","I feel many anti-hard-forkers are looking at the problem from a wrong angle and have forgotten where we are coming from, and what Ethereum is.

Ethereum is a billion dollar project that is gonna be worth a whole lot less once a huge amount of tokens are in the hands of one malicious attacker who can disrupt the network and the eco-system in any way he pleases.

What some here don't seem to understand is that ETH is first and foremost a token to burn CPU time for software requiring CPU cycles. This is NOT just a little coin to buy and sell goods.

The main task here is to keep the network away from disruption and keep everything running stable. The price of the ether and the perception of the coin are absolutely secondary. 

The main thing is the ethereum computer, and if it can run stable, the ethers which are required to hire CPU cycles become a scarce resource and that's what makes ETHER valuable. And only then it becomes really interesting to trade for goods and services.

The hard fork is a necessary protection mechanism for the network to defend itself against a malicious attacker that's waiting and getting ready to attack the ethereum computer. This has absolutely nothing to do with ""bailing out"" investors.

Anti-forkers who are only in this for the money, for the investment, should put more time in checking what they are actually investing in. Then they wouldn't be comparing this so much against other cryptocurrencies and they wouldn't start talking about bailouts.

3809,ethereum,The ExtraBalance account of the DAO: a hard fork suggestion,"I believe it'd be best to begin by saying that I am a DAO token holder. I bought in to the DAO at peak hype for 1.3 ETH / 100 DAO, and I even convinced a friend to buy in two days later for 1.5 ETH / 100 DAO. I, like many who purchased DAO tokens, was riding a wave of enthusiasm and optimism that is fundamentally a strength of the Ethereum community; in this case, however, I and many others were optimistic to a fault. Without any due diligence, I based my investment solely on a slick website and an abstract idea, and if the 'immutable' code of the DAO had not been exploited, I think it's likely that I would have lost money anyways as the DAO autonomously mismanaged my Ether. 

It's my feeling that many people on this sub are dissatisfied with the hard fork on moral grounds. That is to say, in its simplest form a full DAO refund through a hard fork would be a ""do over"" -- people like me, who made an investment without doing due diligence, would get a simple 'get out of jail free' card, and might set a precedent for future DAOs and other Dapps. I understand and respect that position, while affirming that a hard fork is absolutely necessary to prevent ""DAO wars III: Revenge of theDarkDAO"". 

So I'd like to propose a compromise that might satisfy those who think DAO token holders should lie in the bed they made: 

In the hard fork implementation, excise the extraBalance Ether and put it into a smart contract or multi-signature wallet, the purpose of which would be to fund work that prevents future Dapp disasters and security flaws.  

The exact terms and scope of eligible work is worthy of much discussion, but since the funds in the extraBalance seem to come disproportionately from late-adopters and ill-informed investors (of which I am one), it might make sense to keep the purpose limited to things that make such due diligence easier, such as formal proofing tools or transparent and open security audits. The disbursement of the funds to 'worthy' proposals, again, is worth discussing in detail, but I'd like to suggest leaving the contract under the exclusive control of the original DAO curators. 

According to a back of the envelope calculation, removing the extraBalance from the DAO wind-down would bring the Value of one DAO to 0.00977 ETH. So, early adopters and lucky bandwagoners will take a small trim, moral hard(fork)liners will grumble a little less, and people like me will at least have the benefit of knowing that our original terrible investment is contributing positively to newer and better smart contracts down the chain. ",1467308550
3810,ethereum,"The DAO is NOT Ethereum, ETH investors are NOT by definition investors of the DAO","From the many comments I have received on posts talking about pro fork, it appears now clear that the main confusion from DAO investors is that they consider the DAO to be Ethereum and the governance of the DAO to be the governance behind Ethereum. This is just wrong. It's not because DAO tokens are purchased with ETH that a DAO holder is automatically an ETH investor. Buying ETH through the BTC portal doesn't make you a BTC investor...
Ethereum is a blockchain that allows the usage of smart contracts which are paid for with ETH. The DAO was a funding vehicle that used the technology behind smart contracts to allow token holders to fund projects. The coding system as part of those Ethereum smart contracts is solid and secure. The wrong combination of those codes, the lack of testing and the centralization of a massive pool of money into a single fund is a responsibility for which bad consequences should be beared by the DAO itself and NOT the Ethereum foundation devs. Doing otherwise just sends the wrong signal to the Ethereum community and future institutional participants that its devs would rather risk the devaluation of its own project to the benefit of bailing out failed external projects.
The ETH market with its supply/demand and fundamentals is strong enough to overcome a massive dump. With a sell comes a buy. Without any fork, the horizon is bright, the Ethereum community will overcome and the product will grow. Sadly, not so much with a fork.

3811,ethereum,Blockchains Only Have probabilistic resistance to change backed by economic incentives - nothing more and nothing less - The Market Is Telling Us Change Is Economically Warranted Now.,"I see so many arguments about the hard fork that seem to miss the entire point of blockchains. They were never immutable. That's a big point that bears repeating: They were never immutable. The entire theory of resistance to change is based on economic incentives and disincentives. 

Take bitcoin/ethereum POW for example. The idea is that miners have a stake in the value of the network through income from mining rewards and in the value in resistance to change. So they would not collude to arbitrarily revert transactions, even if they could steal money by doing it, because it would destroy the value of their mining operation and their stolen funds.  By making the change they would suffer a net economic loss, so as rational actors, they don't do it. This is the primary, if not sole, economic incentive that provides resistance to change. But this is not immutability. [Edit: Note this is directly from Satoshi's original bitcoin paper, Section 6 entitled ""Incentive"" https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf]

Blockchains are not inherently immutable. it is only the economic incentives against change that provide resistance to change. Now, when those incentives change -- as in the case of preventing something that would harm the network or helping something good for the network (Homestead) -- then the resistance to change disappears and turns into an economic incentive to change. Thus, beneficial hard forks exist. There are lots of reasons why the currently contemplated hard fork is good: a potentially malicious actor owning a large stake of ether would be viewed as bad; regulators may come down harder and faster if there's a $150mm loss; at this point, even the white hat DAO's 7+mm may be lost without a fork; the DAO was meant to spur innovation through investment and losing that money, at least some of which, would likely be put towards new investments is terrible loss for the network's growth. On the other hand, the case against the fork seems to be: change is bad, if you change the DAO contract code and take away the thief's money we'll lose our claim to immutable contracts. The key question here is: what do the economic incentives and disincentives tell us is the correct path?

You may have your own opinion on whether a fork here is good for the network, but the economics are all that really matter. Having an ideological position on it, such that any change results in a loss of immutability is just logically fallacious. You can argue that a change would be economically bad because reasons, but anything else makes little sense. 

But the markets seem to universally be saying that a network change in this case to recover the funds is economically good. Markets are very good indicators of economic interest after all, and every time the seeming probability of a recovery fork increases, ether price increases, and whenever something seems to call that into question (like the reversion of the soft fork) the price decreases. The market is speaking and any rational actor would do well to listen. ",1467309234

3820,ethereum,Help needed! My autonomous code turned into a monster!,"So buddy and me had some beers the other day and up came this great idea for a Dapp: a crawler that would make a list of tipjar addresses of white hat hackers and tip them some coins every single day they were online and active. We called it the WhiteHatTipper. 

Anyway we had a hackathon last night to smash it out. Code looked sound, we put all of our life savings in it, let it loose and went to bed. 

Now this morning we woke up and turned out the Tipper dumped all of the funds into the first tipjar he bumped into! On top of that, it's a black hat hacker...! 

Any solutions? In retrospect we might have been a bit sloppy with the code but it's all the money we have! This was not supposed to happen.

We contacted the hacker but he says Ethereum transactions are irreversible and it's our own fault. 

So now we were thinking maybe we propose a hard fork...?",1467314276

If there is no successful fork, be it soft or hard. We will never hear the end of it, that I can promise. The attacker will be the talk of the town for the foreseeable future and the incentive to talk about him will grow as Ethereum grows.

The attacker will be our version of Satoshi, albeit an evil one. (and present)

A constant reminder and nuance at every stage of development and media cycle.

A constant worry for traders and investors. They will have to factor in the uncertainty with what the attackers next move may be. For example once in a while just by sending his coins to another address the market would have a reaction. Add some mediocre social engineering on top of it and you have chaos. Profitable (and enjoyable) chaos for the person with the sticks.

What is going on? Is he trying to sell? Is he buying into another DAO? x1000

Ohh what's that? A controversial smart contract with bad intentions. Let's hope it doesn't get much if any attention..

Ohh what's that? The wealthiest person in the ecosystem, Aka ""Coindesk's love child"", Aka ""the thief"" just gave it a mill, great. Why wouldn't he? The whole internet would talk about him again. That shit is addicting. So is money I have heard.

Step 1. Short Eth

Step 2. Buy into evil DAO

Step 3. Profit.

It would literately be that simple. He could, if he wanted to, terrorize Ethereum while making a killing on the markets. #nsafiltertriggered

Anyone opposed to a fork please tell me how Ethereum is viable going forward with this in mind and while your at it, promise me that if there is no fork, that you will be here explaining to every newcomer, about that one time ""Ethereum got hacked"" and why we couldn't do anything about it. And please if you could follow that up with an advise to invest in Ethereum, see how that goes.

On the same token, if we successfully fork I will gladly be here, telling everyone about that one time people got carried away in the early days of Ethereum and put to much money in a smart contract that was not ready. But despite the worst case scenario the community rallied together, solved the problem and everyone came out of it a bit wiser, with a lesson and the knowledge that any future fork clearly has almost no chance of going through, unless there is a systemic disaster highly motivating everyone.

Because if this fork really is ""controversial"" then I would love to see the fork that isn't. I can only imagine.

3833,ethereum,"Fork Vote by Ether commitment, version 2.","I'm making a second round at this vote by locking thing, basing on a lot of the feedback I received from the last time. If you missed, here's the gist of it:

* You vote by committing not to move your ether (or DAO tokens) for a given period of time IF a given fork is activated (or none is). The more ether you lock and the longer you are willing to hold it (last one is squared) the more weight your vote has.

* The fork which has the largest amount of people willing to lock is also, by definition, the one in which the least amount of people want to jump ship because they don't want to be involved in the project anymore and should be the more valuable chain long term, meaning miners and exchanges have the incentive to adopt it.

Since I last proposed this, I made some changes to it:

* Each vote is a separate contract, which can only be operated by it's owner, this reduces the risk of a bug that affects everyone.

* You can also vote with DAO tokens (since this is the reason we are debating it) - or actually any other coin. How these are calculated is a different manner but for simplicity sake we can make 100 DAO : 1 ether or whatever was the price at the end of the crowdsale.

* The maximum period is set at 3 months, which is a long time in this space. There is no minimum time to hold, but since the vote weight as (lock date - fork date)² anyone holding for less than a day will have their vote weight drastically reduced. The 3 month limit also limits the chances of there being another vote coming up before that.

* You can support any number of fork proposals, with different lock dates.

* The lock is only activated if there is a large support from miners. They can start the lock at any point and they also have the power to unlock everyone's coin if something comes up.

### Why?

I think pure coin votes are fundamentally unjust, as very few people have much larger power. I don't feel we should be building a system in which the wealthiest minority or an angry majority have unlimited power over everyone else's property and wealth - history has shown that neither of those create a nice society.

If we are going to open a precedent to decide on either to fork or not and which fork to choose, then we should at least try to make some system that can be built right now and makes some sort of sense. 

PS. I am [also working on a mist Ðapp that will be pure coin vote](https://github.com/alexvandesande/stake-voice/blob/master/README.md) but I don't feel it's really good for such an important decision.",1467321845
